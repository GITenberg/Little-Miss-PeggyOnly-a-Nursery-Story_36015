<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A BREAKFAST PARTY<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
"Henry was every morning fed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With a full mess of milk and bread."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;"><span class="smcap">Mary Lamb.</span></span><br />
<br /></div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">No</span>," said Peggy to herself, with a little sigh, "the
naughty clouds has covered it up to-day. I can't
see it."</div>

<p>"Miss Peggy," came nurse's voice from the other
side of the room, "your breakfast's waiting. Come
to the table, my dear, and stand quiet while Master
Thor says the grace."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 455px;">
<img src="images/i001.jpg" width="455" height="700" alt="&quot;&mdash;Baby, who required a great deal of room to himself at table, baby though he was....&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>Nurse spoke kindly, but she meant what she
said. Peggy turned slowly from the window and
took her place among her brothers. She, and Thorold
and Terence, the two oldest boys, sat opposite nurse,
and beside nurse was Baby, who required a great deal
of room to himself at table, baby though he was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
He had so many things to do during a meal, you
see, which grown-up children think quite unnecessary.
He had to drum with a spoon, first in one
fat hand and then in the other; he had to dip his
crust first in nurse's cup of tea and next in Hal's
jug of milk to see which tasted best, and there would
have been no fun in doing either if he hadn't had
to stretch a long way across; and besides all this
he felt really obliged now and then to put his feet
upon the table for a change, one at a time, of course.
For even he, clever as he was, could not have got
both together out of the bars of his chair without
toppling over. Nurse had for some time past been
speaking about beginning "to break Master Baby
in," but so far it had not got beyond speaking, and
she contented herself with seating him beside her
and giving him a good quarter of the table to himself,
the only objection to which was that it gave
things in general a rather lopsided appearance.</p>

<p>At the two ends sat Baldwin and Hal. Hal's
real name, of course, was Henry, though he was
never called by it. Baldwin, on the contrary, had
no short name, partly perhaps because mamma
thought "Baldie" sounded so ugly, and partly because
there was something about Baldwin himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
which made one not inclined to shorten his name.
It suited him so well, for he was broad and comfortable
and slow. He was never in a hurry, and
he gave you the feeling that you needn't be in a
hurry either. There was plenty of time for everything,
for saying the whole of his name as well as
for everything else.</p>

<p>That made a lot of brothers, didn't it? Five,
counting baby, and to match them, or rather not
to match them&mdash;for five and one are not a match
at all&mdash;only one little girl! She wondered about it
a good deal, when she had nothing else more interesting
to wonder about. It seemed so very badly
managed that she should have five brothers, and
that the five brothers should only have one sister
each. It wasn't always so, she knew. The children
at the back had plenty of both brothers and sisters;
she had found that out already. But I must not
begin just yet about the children at the back; you
will hear about them in good time.</p>

<p>There was a nice bowl of bread-and-milk at each
child's place, and as bread-and-milk is much better
hot than cold, it was generally eaten up quickly.
But this morning, even after the grace was said, and
the four brothers who weren't baby had got on very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
well with theirs, Peggy sat, spoon in hand, gazing
before her and not eating at all.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Miss Peggy?" said nurse,
when she had at last made Baby understand that he
really <i>wasn't</i> to try to put his toes into her tea-cup,
which had struck him suddenly as a very beautiful
thing to do; "you've not begun to eat. Are you
waiting for the sugar or the salt, or can't you fix
which you want this morning?"</p>

<p>For there was a very nice and interesting rule in
that nursery that every morning each child might
choose whether he or she would have salt or sugar
in the bread and milk. The only thing was that
they had to be quick about choosing, and that was
not always very easy.</p>

<p>Peggy looked up when nurse spoke to her.</p>

<p>"Peggy wasn't 'toosing," she said. Then she
grew a little red. "<i>I</i> wasn't 'toosing," she went on.
For Peggy was five&mdash;five a good while ago&mdash;and she
wanted to leave off baby ways of talking. "I was
wondering."</p>

<p>"Well, eat your breakfast, and when you've got
half-way down the bowl you can tell us what you
were wondering about," said nurse.</p>

<p>Peggy's spoon, already laden, continued its journey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to her mouth. But when it got there, and its contents
were safely deposited between her two red lips,
she gave a little cry.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, "it doesn't taste good. There's
no salt or sugar."</p>

<p>"'Cos you didn't put any in, you silly girl,"
said Thor. "I saw, but I thought it'd be a good
lesson. People shouldn't wonder when they're
eating."</p>

<p>"Peggy wasn't eating; she was only going to
eat," said Terry. "Never mind, Peg-top. Thor
shan't tease you. Which'll you have? Say quick,"
and he pulled forward the sugar-basin and the salt-cellar
in front of his sister.</p>

<p>"Sugar, pelease," said Peggy. "It's so 'told this
morning."</p>

<p>At this Thor burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"What a Peggy-speech," he said. "Sugar's no
warmer than salt."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Baldwin, solemnly, from the other end
of the table. "'Tis. There's sugar in toffee and in
jam, and they're hot, leastways they're hot to be
made. And there's salt in ices, for mamma said
they're made with salt."</p>

<p>"What rubbish!" said Thor. "Nurse, isn't it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
rubbish? And when did you ever see ices, I'd like
to know, Baldwin?"</p>

<p>"I did," Baldwin maintained. "Onst. But I'll
not tell you when, if you say rubbish."</p>

<p>"It is rubbish all the same, and I'll prove it,"
said Thor. "You know that nice smooth white sugar
on the top of bridescake?&mdash;well, they ice that to put
it on&mdash;I know they do. Don't they, nurse?"</p>

<p>"They call it icing, to be sure," nurse replied.
"But that's no proof that ices themselves mayn't be
made with salt, Master Thor, for when you come to
think of it ices have sugar in them."</p>

<p>"To be sure they have," Thor cried, triumphantly.
"Nurse has proved it&mdash;that sugar's no warmer than
salt," which was not what nurse had intended to say
at all.</p>

<p>But now Peggy, who all this time had been
steadily eating, looked up again.</p>

<p>"Peggy was wondering," she said, "what's clouds.
Is clouds alive?"</p>

<p>Thor was all ready with his "you silly girl" again,
but this time Terry was before him.</p>

<p>"They can't be alive," he said. "They've got
no hands, or feet, or mouths, and noses, and eyes,
and&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"They <i>has</i> noses," said Peggy, eagerly. "Peggy's
seen them, and they has wings&mdash;the little ones has
wings, they fly so fast. And p'raps they has got
proper faces on their other sides, to look at the sun
with. I've seen shiny bits of the other sides
turned over."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Baldwin, solemnly again, as if that
settled it, "so has I."</p>

<p>"But they're not alive, Peggy, they're really not.
They fly because the wind blows them," said Terence.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Peggy, with a deep-drawn breath, "I
see. Then if we all blowed very hard at the window,
if we all blowed together, couldn't we blow them
away? I do so want to blow them away when they
come over my hills."</p>

<p>But when she had said this she grew very red,
just as if she had told something she had not meant
to tell, and if any one had looked at her quite close
they would have seen that there were tears in her
eyes. Fortunately, however, no one had noticed her
last words, for Thorold and Terence too had burst
out laughing at the beginning of her speech.</p>

<p>"Fancy us all blowing out of the window together,"
they said. And they began puffing out their
cheeks and pretending to blow very hard, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
made them look so funny that Peggy herself burst
out laughing too.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," said Thor, when they were
tired of laughing, "that reminds me of soap-bubbles,
we haven't had any for such a time. Nurse, will
you remember to let us have them the first wet half-holiday?
Mamma'll let us if you will."</p>

<p>"And the pipes?" said nurse. "There was six
new got the last time, and they were to last, certain
sure till the next time, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh I know," said Thor, "we took them to school
and never brought them back. Never mind&mdash;we'll
get some more from old Mother Whelan. She always
keeps lots. We'll keep our halfpennies for two
Saturdays&mdash;that'll do. But we must be going, Terry
and Baldwin. <i>I'm</i> all ready."</p>

<p>And he jumped up as he spoke, and pulled his
satchel of books from under his chair, where he had
put them to be all ready. Baldwin slowly got down
from his place, for he was not only broad, but his
legs were very short, and came up to nurse to be
helped on with his little overcoat, while Terence
began rushing about the room in a fuss, looking for
one of his books, which as usual couldn't be found
at the last minute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had it just before breakfast, I'm <i>sure</i> I had,"
he went on repeating. "I haven't finished learning
it, and I meant to look it over. Oh dear, what shall
I do?"</p>

<p>The nursery party was too accustomed to Terry's
misfortunes to be much upset by them. Peggy
sat still for a moment or two considering. Then she
spoke.</p>

<p>"Terry," she said, "look in Baby's cot."</p>

<p>Off flew Terence, returning in triumph, grammar
in hand.</p>

<p>"I'll learn it on the way to school. How did you
know it was there, Peggy?"</p>

<p>"I sawed you reaching over to kiss Baby when
you comed in to ask nurse for a new shoe-lace this
morning," said Peggy, with great pride.</p>

<p>"Good girl," said Terence, as he slammed the
door and rushed downstairs to overtake his two
brothers.</p>

<p>The nursery seemed very quiet when the three
big boys had gone. Quiet but not idle; there was
always a great deal to do first thing of a morning,
and Peggy had her own share of the doing to see to.
She took off her own breakfast pinafore and put on
a quite clean one&mdash;one that looked quite clean anyway,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
just as if it had never been on, even though it
had really been used two or three times. Peggy
called it her "prayers pinafore," and it always
lasted a whole week, as it was only worn to go
down to the dining-room for five or ten minutes.
Then she washed her hands and stood still for nurse
to give a tidying touch to her soft fair hair, though
it really didn't need it,&mdash;Peggy's hair never looked
messy,&mdash;and then she took off Hal's over pinafore
which he wore on the top of his blouse at meal-times,
and helped him to wash his hands, by which
time nurse and baby were also ready, and the little
procession set off on their journey. If the prayers
bell had not sounded yet, or did not sound as they
made their way down, nurse would stop at mamma's
door and tap, and the answer was sure to be "Come
in." Then nurse would go on downstairs with Baby,
and Peggy and Hal would trot in to see mamma, and
wait a moment or two till she was ready. She was
almost always nearly ready, unless she was very,
very tired; and in that case she would tell them to
go downstairs and come up and see her again after
prayers, as she was going to have breakfast in bed.
They rather liked these days, though of course they
were sorry for mamma to be so tired, but it was very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
interesting to watch her having her breakfast,
and generally one or two dainty bits of toast and
marmalade would find their way to the two little
mouths.</p>

<p>It was only since last winter that mamma had
been so often tired and not able to get up early.
Before then she used always to come up to the
nursery to see her six children at breakfast, and
prayers were early enough for the three boys to stay
for them, instead of having them at school. For
mamma was not at all a "lazy" mother, as you
might think if I did not explain. But last winter
she had been very ill indeed, so ill that papa looked
dreadfully unhappy, and the boys had to take off
their boots downstairs so as not to make any noise
when they passed her door, and the days seemed
very long to Peggy and Hal, worst to Peggy of
course, for Hal was still so little that almost all his
life belonged to the nursery. It was during that
time that Peggy first found out the white spot on
the hill, which I am going to tell you about, for she
used to climb up on the window-sill and sit there
looking out at whatever there was to see for hours
at a time.</p>

<p>This morning mamma was evidently not tired,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
for just as the children got to the landing on to
which her door opened, out she came.</p>

<p>"Well, darlings," she said, "there you are! Have
the boys got off to school all rightly, nurse?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, ma'am," nurse was beginning, but Peggy
interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Terry loosed his book, mamma dear, and Peg&mdash;<i>I</i>
founded it; I knewed where it was 'cos I used my
eyes like you said."</p>

<p>"That was a very good thing," said mamma.
She had talked to Peggy about using her eyes a
good deal, for Peggy had rather a trick of going to
sleep with her eyes open, like many children, and it
becomes a very tiresome trick if it isn't cured, and
makes one miss a great many chances of being useful
to others, and of enjoying pleasant things one's
self. "Poor Terry&mdash;I wish he wasn't so careless.
Where was his book this time?"</p>

<p>"In such a funny place, mamma dear," said
Peggy. "In Baby's cot," and at the sound of his
name Baby crowed, which made both Peggy and Hal
burst out laughing, so that mamma had to hold
their hands firmly to prevent their tumbling down
stairs.</p>

<p>After prayers were over nurse took Baby and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Hal away, but papa said Peggy might stay for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>"I've scarcely seen you the last day or two, old
woman," he said; "you were fast asleep when I
came home. What have you been about?"</p>

<p>"About," Peggy repeated, looking puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what have you been doing with yourself?"
he said again.</p>

<p>"I've been doing nothing with <i>myself</i>," Peggy
replied, gravely. "I've done my lessons and my sewing,
and I've used my eyes."</p>

<p>"Well, and isn't all that yourself?" asked papa,
who was rather a tease. "You've done your sewing
with your fingers and your lessons with your mind,
and you've used your eyes for both&mdash;mind, fingers,
eyes&mdash;those are all parts of yourself."</p>

<p>Peggy spread out her two hands on the table and
looked at the ten pink fingers.</p>

<p>"Them's my fingers," she said, "but I don't know
where that other thing is&mdash;that what thinks. I'd
like to know where it is. Papa, can't you tell me?"</p>

<p>There came a puzzled look into her soft gray
eyes&mdash;mamma knew that look; when it stayed long
it was rather apt to turn into tears.</p>

<p>"Arthur," she said to Peggy's papa, "you're too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fond of teasing. Peggy dear, nobody can see that
part of you; there are many things we can't ever
see, or hear, or touch, which are real things all the
same."</p>

<p>Peggy's face lightened up again. She nodded
her head softly, as if to say that she understood.
Then she got down from her chair and went up to
her father to kiss him and say good-bye.</p>

<p>"Going already, Peg!" he said. "Don't you like
papa teasing you?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind," said Peggy, graciously; "you're
only a big boy, papa. I'm going 'cos nurse wants
me to keep Baby quiet while she makes the beds."</p>

<p>But when she got round to the other side of the
table to her mother, she lingered a moment.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she whispered, "<i>it's</i> not there this
morning&mdash;Peggy's fairy house. It's all hided up.
Mamma&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, darling?"</p>

<p>"Are you <i>sure</i> it'll come back again?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, dear. It's only hidden by the clouds,
as I've told you before. You know you've often
been afraid it was gone, and it's always come again."</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure," said Peggy. "What a silly
little girl I am, mamma dear."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>And she laughed her own little gentle laugh. I
can't tell how it was that Peggy's little laugh used
sometimes to bring tears to her mother's eyes.</p>

<p>When she got up to the nursery again she found
she was very much wanted. Nurse was in the night
nursery which opened into the day one, and looked
out to the back of the house just as the other looked
to the front. And Baby was sitting on the hearth-rug,
with Hal beside him, both seeming far from
happy.</p>

<p>"Baby's defful c'oss, Peggy," said poor Hal.</p>

<p>And Baby, though he couldn't speak, pouted out
his lips and looked very savage at Hal, which of
course was very unreasonable and ungrateful of him,
as Hal had been doing everything he could to amuse
him, and had only objected to Baby pulling him
across the floor by his curls.</p>

<p>"Oh Baby," said Peggy, "that isn't good. Poor
Hal's hair&mdash;see how you've tugged it."</p>

<p>For Baby was still grasping some golden threads
in his plump fists.</p>

<p>"Him sinks zem's feaders," said Hal, apologetically.
He was so fond of Baby that he couldn't
bear any one to say anything against him except
himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 458px;">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="458" height="700" alt="&quot;And in another moment they were settled..." title="" />
</div>

<p>"But Baby must learn hairs isn't feathers," said
Peggy, solemnly. "And it isn't good to let him pull
the feathers out of his parrot either, Hal," she continued,
"for some day he might have a <i>live</i> parrot,
and then it would be cooel, and the parrot would
<i>bite</i> him&mdash;yes it would, Baby."</p>

<p>This was too much for Baby. He drew the
corner of his mouth down, then he opened it wide,
very wide, and was just going to roar when Peggy
threw her arms round him and kissed him vigorously.</p>

<p>"He's sorry, Hal&mdash;dear Baby&mdash;he's so very sorry.
Kiss him, Hal. Let's all kiss together," and the
three soft faces all met in a bunch, which Baby
found so amusing that instead of continuing his
preparations for a good cry, he thought better of it,
and went off into a laugh.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Peggy. "Now if you'll both
be very good boys I'll tell you a story. Just wait a
minute till I've tooked off my prayers pinafore."</p>

<p>She jumped up to do so. While she was unfastening
it her eyes moved to the window; she
gave a little cry and ran forward. The day was
clearing up, the sun was beginning faintly to shine,
and the clouds were breaking.</p>


<p>"Mamma was right," exclaimed Peggy, joyfully;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
"I can see it&mdash;I can see it! I can see my white
house again, my dear little fairy house."</p>

<p>She would have stayed there gazing out contentedly
half the morning if her little brothers had
not called her back.</p>

<p>"Peggy," said Hal, plaintively, "do tum. Baby's
pulling Hal's 'air adain."</p>

<p>"Peggy's coming, dear," said the motherly little
voice.</p>

<p>And in another moment they were settled on the
hearth-rug&mdash;Baby on Peggy's lap&mdash;on, and off it too,
for it was much too small to accommodate the whole
of him; Hal on the floor beside her, his curly head
leaning on his sister's shoulder in blissful and trustful
content.</p>

<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Telling</span> stories," when the teller is only five and some
months old, and the hearers one and a quarter and
three, is rather a curious performance. But Peggy was
well used to it, and when in good spirits quite able
to battle with the difficulties of amusing Hal and
Baby at the same time. And these difficulties were
not small, for, compared with Baby, Hal was really
"grown-up."</div>

<p>It is all very well for people who don't know
much about tiny children to speak of them all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
together, up to&mdash;six or seven, let us say&mdash;as "babies,"
but we who think we <i>do</i> know something about
them, can assure the rest of the world that this is an
immense mistake. One year in nursery arithmetic
counts for ten or even more in <i>real</i> "grown-up" life.
There was a great difference between Peggy and Hal
for instance, but a still greater between Hal and
Baby, and had there been a new baby below him
again, of course it would have been the greatest of
all. Peggy could not have explained this in words,
but she knew it thoroughly all the same, and she had
learnt to take it into account in her treatment of the
two, especially in her stories telling. In reality the
story itself was all for Hal, but there was a sort of
running accompaniment for Baby which he enjoyed
very much, and which, to tell the truth, I rather
think Hal found amusing too, though he pretended
it was for Baby's sake.</p>

<p>This morning her glance out of the window had
made Peggy feel so happy that the story promised to
be a great success. She sat still for a minute or two,
her arms clasped round Baby's waist, gently rocking
herself and him to and fro, while her gray eyes
stared before her, as if reading stories in the carpet
or on the wall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Peggy," said Hal at last, giving her a hug&mdash;he
had been waiting what he thought a very long time&mdash;"Peggy,
'do on&mdash;no, I mean begin, p'ease."</p>

<p>"Yes, Hal, d'reckly," said Peggy. "It's coming,
Hal, yes, now I think it's comed. Should we do
piggies first, to please Baby before we begin?"</p>

<p>"Piggies is <i>so</i> silly," said Hal, disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll kiss him instead&mdash;another kiss all
together, he does so like that;" and when the kissing
was over&mdash;"now, Baby dear, listen, and p'raps you'll
understand <i>some</i>, and if you're good we'll have piggies
soon."</p>

<p>Baby gave a kind of grunt; perhaps he was
thinking of the pigs, but most likely it was just his
way of saying he would be very good.</p>

<p>"There was onst," Peggy began, "a little girl
who lived in a big house all by herself."</p>

<p>"Hadn't she no mamma, or nurse, or&mdash;or&mdash;brudders?"
Hal interrupted.</p>

<p>"No, not none," Peggy went on. "She lived
quite alone, and she didn't like it. The house was
as big as a&mdash;as a church, and she hadn't no bed, and
no chairs or tables, and there was very, <i>very</i> high
stairs."</p>

<p>"Is there stairs in churches?" asked Hal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Peggy looked rather puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think there is," she said. "There's people
high up in churches, so there must be stairs. But I
didn't say it <i>were</i> a church, Hal; I only said as big
as a church. And the stairs was for Baby&mdash;you'll
hear&mdash;p'raps there wasn't <i>reelly</i> stairs. Now, Baby;
one day a little piggy-wiggy came up the stairs&mdash;one,
two, three," and Peggy's hand came creeping up
Baby's foot and leg and across his pinafore and up
his bare arm again, by way of illustrating piggy's
progress, "and when he got to the top he said
'grumph,' and poked his nose into the little girl's
neck"&mdash;here Peggy's own nose made a dive among
Baby's double chins, to his exceeding delight, setting
him off chuckling to himself for some time, which
left Peggy free to go on with the serious part of the
story for Hal's benefit&mdash;"and there was a window in
the big house, and the little girl used to sit there
always looking out."</p>

<p>"Always?" asked Hal again. "All night too?
Didn't her ever go to bed?"</p>

<p>"She hadn't no bed, I told you. No, she didn't
sit there all night, 'cos she couldn't have see'd in the
dark. Never mind about the night. She sat there
all day, always looking out, 'cos there was something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
she liked to see. If I tell you you won't tell nobody
what it was, will you. Hal?"</p>

<p>Hal looked very mystified, but replied obediently,</p>

<p>"No, won't tell nobody," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll tell you what it was. It was
a&mdash;&mdash;" But at this moment Baby, having had enough
of his own meditations, began to put in a claim to
some special attention. The piggy had to be summoned
and made to run up and down stairs two or
three times before he would be satisfied and allow
Peggy to proceed.</p>

<p>"Well, Peggy?" said Hal eagerly.</p>

<p>"It was a&mdash;&mdash;" Oh dear, interrupted again! But
this time the interruption was a blessing in disguise.
It was nurse come to fetch Baby for his morning
sleep.</p>

<p>"And thank you, Miss Peggy, my dear, for keeping
him so nice and good. I heard you come up,
and I knew they'd be all right with you," she said,
as she walked away with Baby, who was by no
means sure that he wanted to go.</p>

<p>"Now," said Hal, edging closer to Peggy, "we'll
be comfable. Go on, Peggy&mdash;what she sawed."</p>

<p>"It was a hill&mdash;far, far away, neely as far as the
sky," said Peggy in a mysterious tone. "When the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sun comed she could see it plain&mdash;the hill and what
was there, but when the sun goed she couldn't.
There was a white spot on the hill, Hal, and that
white spot was a lovely white cottage. She knowed
it, though she'd never see'd it."</p>

<p>"How did she know it?"</p>

<p>"Her mam&mdash;no, that's wrong, she hadn't no
mamma&mdash;well, never mind, <i>somebody</i>'d told her."</p>

<p>"Were it <i>God?</i>" asked Hal, in an awestruck
whisper.</p>

<p>"I don't know. No, I don't think so. I think
it's a little naughty to say that, Hal. No, dear,
don't cry," for signs of disturbance were visible in
Hal's round face. "You didn't mean, and it isn't
never naughty when we don't mean, you know.
We'll go on about the little girl. She knowed it
was a lovely cottage, and she wanted <i>very</i> much, as
much as could be, to go there, for the big house
wasn't pretty, and it was dark, nearly black, and the
cottage was all white."</p>

<p>"Her house wasn't as nice as <i>zit</i>, were it? Zit
house isn't b'ack," said Hal.</p>

<p>"No," said Peggy, doubtfully. "<i>It</i> wasn't as nice
as this, but the white house was much prettier than
this."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"How?" asked Hal.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Peggy, letting her eyes and her fancy
rove about together, "I think it was beautiful all
over. It was all shiny white; the walls was white,
and the carpets was white, and the tables and the
chairs was white&mdash;all shiny and soft like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Baby's best sash," suggested Hal.</p>

<p>"Well, p'raps&mdash;that'll do. And there was a cow
and chickens and sheep, and a kitchen where you
could make cakes, and a garden with lots of flowers
and strawberries&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All white?" asked Hal.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. Strawberries couldn't be
white, and flowers is all colours. 'Twas the <i>droind-room</i>
that was all white."</p>

<p>"And the milk and the eggs. Zem <i>is</i> white,"
said Hal, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Very well. I didn't say they wasn't. But the
story goes on that the little girl didn't know how to
get there; it was so far and so high up. So she sat
and cried all alone at the window."</p>

<p>"All alone, <i>poor</i> little girl," said Hal, with deep
feeling. "Kick, Peggy, kick, I'm 'doing to cry;
make it come right <i>kick</i>. The crying's just coming."</p>

<p>"Make it wait a minute. I can't make it come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
right all so quick," said Peggy. "It's going to
come, so make the crying wait. One day she was
crying d'edful, worst than never, 'cos the sun had
goned, and she couldn't see the white cottage no
more, and just then she heard something saying,
'mew, mew,' and it was a kitten outside the window,
and it was just going to fall down and be killed."</p>

<p>"That's not coming right. I <i>must</i> cry," said Hal.</p>

<p>"But she opened the window&mdash;there now, you
see&mdash;and she pulled the kitten in, so it didn't fall
down, and it was so pleased it kissed her, and when
it kissed her it turned into a fairy, and it touched
her neck and made wings come, and then it opened
the window again and flewed away with the little
girl till they came to the white cottage, and then
the little girl was quite happy for always."</p>

<p>"Did the fairy stay with her always?" asked Hal.</p>

<p>"No; fairies never does like that. They go back
to fairyland. But the little girl had nice milk and
eggs and cakes, and she made nosegays with the
flowers, and the sun was <i>always</i> shining, so she was
quite, <i>quite</i> happy."</p>

<p>"Her couldn't be happy all alone," said Hal.
"I don't like zat story, Peggy. You haven't made
it nice at all. It's a nonsense story."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Hal wriggled about and seemed very cross. Poor
Peggy was not so much indignant as distressed at
failing in her efforts to amuse him. What was the
matter? It couldn't be that he was getting sleepy&mdash;it
was far too early for his morning sleep.</p>

<p>"It isn't a nonsense story," she said, and she
glanced towards the window as she spoke. Yes, the
sun was shining brightly, the morning clouds had
quite melted away; it was going to be a fine day
after all. And clear and white gleamed out the
spot on the distant hill which Peggy loved to gaze
at! "Come here, Hal," she said, getting on to her
feet and helping Hal on to his, "come with me to
the window and you'll see if it's a nonsense story.
Only you've never to tell nobody. It's Peggy's own
secret."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 458px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="458" height="700" alt="&#39;And above the top of all the houses, clear though faint, was now to be seen the outline of a range of hills...." title="" />
</div>

<p>Hal forgot his crossness in a minute; he felt so
proud and honoured. Peggy led him to the window.
It was not a very pretty prospect; they looked out
on to a commonplace street, houses on both sides,
though just opposite there was a little variety in
the shape of an old-fashioned, smoke-dried garden.
Beyond that again, more houses, more streets, stretching
away out into suburbs, and somewhere beyond
all that again the mysterious, beautiful, enchanting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
region which the children spoke of and believed in
as "the country," not really so far off after all,
though to them it seemed so.</p>

<p>And above the tops of all the houses, clear
though faint, was now to be seen the outline of a
range of hills, so softly gray-blue in the distance
that but for the irregular line never changing in its
form, one could easily have fancied it was only the
edge of a quickly passing ridge of clouds. Peggy,
however, knew better.</p>

<p>"See, Hal," she said, "over there, far, far
away, <i>neely</i> in the sky, does you see that bluey
hill?"</p>

<p>Of course he saw, agreeing so readily that Peggy
was sure he did not distinguish rightly, which was
soon proved to be the case by his announcing that
"The 'ill were sailing away."</p>

<p>"No, no, it isn't," Peggy cried. "You've mustooked
a cloud, Hal. See now," and by bringing
her own eyes exactly on a level with a certain spot
on the glass she was able to place his correctly,
"just over that little bubble in the window you can
see it. Its top goes up above the bubble and then
down and then up again, and it never moves like
the clouds&mdash;does you see now, Hallie dear?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Zes, zes," said Hal, "but it's a <i>wenny</i> little 'ill,
Peggy."</p>

<p>"No, dear," his sister explained. "It only looks
little 'cos it's so far away. <i>You</i> is too little to understand,
dear, but it's true that it's a big hill, neely a
mounting, Hal. Mamma told me."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Hal, profoundly impressed and quite
convinced.</p>

<p>"Mountings is <i>old</i> hills, or big hills," Peggy
continued, herself slightly confused. "I don't know
if they is the papas and mammas of the little ones,
but I think it's something like that, for onst in
church I heard the clergymunt read that the little
hills jumped for joy, so they must be the children.
I'll ask mamma, and then I'll tell you. I'm not
quite sure if he meaned the same kind, for these
hills never jumps&mdash;that's how mamma told me to
know they wasn't clouds."</p>

<p>"Zes," said Hal, "but go on about the secret,
Peggy. Hal doesn't care about the 'ills."</p>

<p>"But the secret's <i>on</i> the hills," replied Peggy.
"Look more, Hal&mdash;does you see a teeny, <i>teeny</i> white
spot on the bluey hill? Higher up than the bubble,
but not at the top quite?"</p>

<p>Hal's eyes were good and his faith was great.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Zes, zes," he cried. "I does see it&mdash;kite plain,
Peggy."</p>

<p>"Well, Hallie," Peggy continued, "<i>that's</i> my
secret."</p>

<p>"Is it the fairy cottage, and is the little girl
zere now?" Hal asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>Peggy hesitated.</p>

<p>"It is a white cottage," she said. "Mamma told
me. She looked at it through a seeing pipe."</p>

<p>"What's a seeing pipe?" Hal interrupted.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you just now. Ask mamma to show
you hers some day. It's too difficult to understand,
but it makes you see things plain. And mamma
found out it was reelly a cottage, a white cottage,
all alone up on the hill&mdash;isn't it sweet of it to be
there all alone, Hallie? And she said I might
think it was a fairy cottage and keep it for my own
secret, only I've telled you, Hal, and you mustn't tell
nobody."</p>

<p>"And is it all like Baby's best sash, and are there
cakes and f'owers and cows?" asked Hal.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I made up the story, you know,
Hal, to please you. I've made lots&mdash;mamma said I
might. But I've never see'd the cottage, you know.
I <i>daresay</i> it's beautiful, white and gold like the story,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that's why I said it. It does so shine when the
sun's on it&mdash;look, look, Hal!"</p>

<p>For as she spoke the sunshine had broken out
again more brilliantly; and the bright, thin sparkle
which often dazzles one between the showers in
unsettled weather, lighted up that quarter of the
sky where the children were gazing, and, to their
fancy at least, the white spot caught and reflected
the rays.</p>

<p>"Oh zes, I see," Hal repeated. "But, Peggy, I'd
like to <i>go</i> zere and to see it. Can't we go, Peggy?
It would be so nice, nicer than making up stories.
And do you think&mdash;oh do you think, Peggy, that
p'raps there's <i>pigs</i> zere, real pigs?"</p>

<p>He clasped his hands entreatingly as he spoke.
Peggy must say there were pigs. Poor Peggy&mdash;it
was rather a comedown after her fairy visions. But
she was too kind to say anything to vex Hal.</p>

<p>"I thought you said pigs was silly," she objected,
gently.</p>

<p>"Playing pigs to make Baby laugh is silly," said
Hal, "and pigs going to market and stayin' at 'ome
and roast beefin', is <i>d'edful</i> silly. But not real pigs."</p>

<p>"Oh well, then, <i>you</i> may think pigs if you like,"
said Peggy. "I don't think I will, but that doesn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
matter. You may have them in the cottage if you
like, only you mustn't tell Thor and Terry and
Baldwin about it."</p>

<p>"I won't tell, on'y you <i>might</i> have them too,"
said Hal discontentedly. "You're not kind, Peggy."</p>

<p>"Don't let's talk about the cottage any more,
then," said Peggy, though her own eyes were fixed
on the far-off white spot as she spoke. "I think
p'raps, Hallie, you're <i>rather</i> too little to care about
it."</p>

<p>"I'm not," said Hal, "and I do care. But I do
like pigs, real pigs. I sawed zem in the country."</p>

<p>"You can't remember," said Peggy. "It's two
whole years since we was in the real country, Hallie,
and you're only three and a half. I know it's two
years. I heard mamma say so to papa, so you
wasn't two then."</p>

<p>"But I did see zem and I do 'amember, 'cos of
pictures," said Hal.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, dear, there is pictures of pigs in your
scrap-book, I know," Peggy agreed. "You get it
now and we'll look for them."</p>

<p>Off trotted Hal, returning in a minute with his
book, and for a quarter of an hour or so his patient
little sister managed to keep him happy and amused.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
At the end of that time, however, he began to be
cross and discontented again. Peggy did not know
what to make of him this morning, he was not often
so difficult to please. She was very glad when nurse
came in to say it was now <i>his</i> time for his morning
sleep, and though Hal grumbled and scolded and
said he was not sleepy she carried him off, and Peggy
was left in peace.</p>

<p>She was not at a loss to employ herself. At
half-past eleven she usually went down to mamma
for an hour's lessons, and it must be nearly that
time now. She got her books together and sat
looking over the one verse she had to learn, her
thoughts roving nevertheless in the direction they
loved best&mdash;away over the chimneys and the smoke;
away, away, up, up to the fairy cottage on the
distant hill.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>"THE CHILDREN AT THE BACK"<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
"It seems to me if I'd money enough,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My heart would be made of different stuff;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I would think about those whose lot is rough."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18.5em;"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hawtrey.</span></span><br />
<br /></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">These</span> children's home was not in a very pretty
place. In front, as I have told you, it looked out
on to a rather ugly street, and there were streets and
streets beyond that again&mdash;streets of straight, stiff,
grim-looking houses, some large and some small, but
all commonplace and dull. And in and out between
these bigger streets were narrower and still uglier
ones, scarcely indeed to be called streets, so dark
and poky were they, so dark and poky were the poor
houses they contained.</div>

<p>The street immediately behind the children's
house, that on to which its back windows looked
out, was one of these poorer ones, though not by any
means one of the most miserable. And ugly though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
it was, Peggy was very fond of gazing out of the
night nursery window on to this street, especially
on days when it was "no use," as she called it to
herself, looking out at the front; that meant, as I
daresay you can guess, days on which it was too
dull and cloudy to see the distant hills, and above
all the white spot, which had taken such hold on her
fancy. For she had found out some very interesting
things in that dingy street. Straight across from the
night nursery window was a very queer miserable
sort of a shop, kept by an old Irishwoman whose
name was Mrs. Whelan. It is rather absurd to call
it a shop, though it was a place where things were
bought and sold, for the room in which these buyings
and sellings went on was Mrs. Whelan's kitchen,
and bedroom, and sitting-room, and wash-house, as
well as her shop! It was on the first floor, and you
got up to it by a rickety staircase&mdash;more like a ladder
indeed than a staircase, and underneath it on the
ground-floor lived a cobbler, with whom Mrs. Whelan
used to quarrel at least once a day, though as he was
a patient, much enduring man, the quarrels never
went farther than the old Irishwoman's opening her
window and shouting down all manner of scoldings
to the poor fellow, of which he took no notice.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 458px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="458" height="700" alt="&quot;She was rather a terrible-looking old woman...." title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sundays the cobbler used to tidy himself up
and go off to church "like a gentleman," the boys
said. But Mrs. Whelan, alas, never tidied herself
up, and never went to church, and though she made
a great show of putting a shutter across that part of
the window which showed "the shop," nurse had
more than once shaken her head when the children
were dressing for church, and told them not to look
over the way, she was sadly afraid the shutting or
shuttering up was all a pretence, and that Mrs. Whelan
made a good penny by her Sunday sales of tobacco
and pipes to the men, or maybe of sugar, candles, or
matches to careless housekeepers who had let their
stock run out too late on Saturday night.</p>

<p>She was rather a terrible-looking old woman; she
always wore a short bed-gown, that is, a loose kind
of jacket roughly drawn in at the waist, of washed-out
cotton, which never looked clean, and yet somehow
never seemed to get much dirtier, a black stuff
petticoat, and a cap with flapping frills which quite
hid her face unless you were very near her, and she
was generally to be seen with a pipe in her mouth.
Her voice was both loud and shrill, and when she
was in a temper you could almost hear what she
said, though the nursery window was shut. All the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
neighbours were afraid of her, and in consequence
treated her with great respect. But like most people
in this world, she had some good about her, as you
will hear.</p>

<p>Good or bad, the children, Peggy especially, found
Mrs. Whelan very interesting. Peggy had never
seen her nearer than from the window, and though
she had a queer sort of wish to visit the shop and
make closer acquaintance with the old crone, she
was far too frightened of her to think of doing so
really. The boys, however, had been several times
inside Mrs. Whelan's dwelling, and used to tell
wonderful stories of the muddle of things it contained,
and of the old woman herself. They always
bought their soap-bubble pipes there, "three a penny,"
and would gladly have bought some of the toffee-balls
and barley-sugar which were also to be had, if
this had not been strictly forbidden by mamma, in
spite of their grumbling.</p>

<p>"It isn't so <i>very</i> dirty, mamma," they said, "and
you get a lot more for a penny than in a proper shop."</p>

<p>But mamma would not give in. She knew what
Mrs. Whelan was like, as she used sometimes to go
over herself to talk to the poor old woman, but that,
of course, was a different matter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't much like your going there at all," she
would say, "but it pleases her for us to buy some
trifles now and then."</p>

<p>But in her heart she wished very much that they
were not obliged to live in this dreary and ugly town,
where their poor neighbours were rarely the sort of
people she could let her children know anything of.
Mamma, in <i>her</i> childhood, had lived in that fairyland
she called "the country," and so had papa, and they
still looked forward to being there again, though for
the present they were obliged to make the best of
their home in a dingy street.</p>

<p>It seemed much less dull and dingy to the children
than to them, however. Indeed I don't think the
children ever thought about it at all. The boys were
busy at school, and found plenty of both work and
play to make the time pass quickly, and Peggy, who
might perhaps have been a little dull and lonely in
her rather shut-up life, had her fancies and her
wonders&mdash;her interesting things to look at both at
the front and the back of the house, and mamma to
tell all about them to! And this reminds me that
I have not yet told you what it was she was <i>most</i>
fond of watching from the night nursery window.
It was not Mrs. Whelan or the cobbler; it was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
tenants of the third or top story of the rickety old
house&mdash;the family she always spoke of to herself as
"the children at the back."</p>

<p>Such a lot of them there were. It was long before
Peggy was able to distinguish them "all from each
other," as she said, and it took her longer still to make
names by which she could keep a clear list in her
head. The eldest looked to her quite grown-up,
though in reality she was about thirteen; she was a
big red-cheeked girl, though she lived in a town; her
arms were red too, poor thing, especially in winter,
for they were seldom or never covered, and she
seemed to be always at work, scrubbing or washing,
or running out to fetch two or three of the little ones
in from playing in the gutter. Peggy called her
"Reddy," and though it was the girl's red cheeks and
arms which made her first choose the name, in a while
she came to think of it as meaning "ready" also,
for Peggy did not know much about spelling as yet,
and the thought in her mind of the look of the two
words was the same. For a good while Peggy fancied
that Reddy was the nurse or servant of the family,
but one day when she said something of the kind to
her own nurse she was quickly put right.</p>

<p>"Their servant, my dear! Bless you, no. How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
could they afford to keep a servant; they've hard
enough work to keep themselves, striving folk though
they seem. There's such a many of them, you see,
and mostly so little&mdash;save that big girl and the sister
three below her, there's none really to help the
mother. And the cripple must be a great charge."</p>

<p>"What's the cripple, nursey?" Peggy asked.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Peggy, haven't you noticed the
white-faced girl on crutches? You must have seen
her dragging up and down in front of the house of a
fine day."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Peggy, "but I didn't know that
was called cripple. And she's quite little; she's as
little as me, nurse!"</p>

<p>"She's older than she looks, poor thing," said
nurse&mdash;"maybe oldest of them all."</p>

<p>This, however, Peggy could not believe. She
fixed in her own mind that "Crippley" came after
the two boys who were evidently next to Reddy&mdash;she
did not give the boys names, for they did not
interest her as much as the girls. Having so many
brothers of her own and no sister, it seemed to her
as if a sister must be the very nicest thing in the
world, and of all the children at the back, the two
that she liked most to watch were a pair of little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
girls about three years older than herself, whom she
named "The Smileys," "Brown Smiley" and "Light
Smiley" when she thought of them separately, for
though they were very like each other, the colour of
their hair was different. They were very jolly little
girls, poorly clad and poorly fed though they were,
taking life easily, it seemed&mdash;too easily in the
opinion of their eldest sister Reddy, and the sister
next above them&mdash;between them and Crippley,
according to Peggy's list. This sister was the only
one whose real name Peggy knew, by hearing it so
frequently shouted after her by the mother and
Reddy. For this child, "Mary-Hann," was rather
deaf, though it was not till long afterwards that
Peggy found this out.</p>

<p>"Mary-Hann" was a patient stupid sort of girl,
a kind of second in command to Reddy, and she was
like Reddy in appearance, except that she was
several sizes smaller and thinner, so that even supposing
that her arms were as red as her sister's they
did not strike one in the same way.</p>

<p>Below the Smileys came another boy, who was
generally to be seen in their company, and who,
according to Peggy, rejoiced in the name of "Tip."
And below Tip were a few babies, in reality I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
believe never more than three, during the years
through which their little over-the-way neighbour
watched them. But even she was obliged to give
up hopes of classifying the babies, for there always
seemed to be <i>a</i> baby about the same age, and one or
two others just struggling into standing or rather
tumbling alone, and for ever being picked up by
Reddy or her attendant sprite Mary-Hann.</p>

<p>Such were Peggy's "children at the back." And
many a dull day when it was too rainy to go a walk,
and too cloudy to be "any use" to gaze out at the
front of the house, did these poor children, little as
they guessed it, help to make pass more quickly
and pleasantly for the sisterless maiden. Many a
morning when Hal and Baby were asleep and nurse
was glad to have an hour or so for a bit of ironing,
or some work of the kind down in the kitchen&mdash;for
my Peggy's papa and mamma were not rich and
could not keep many servants, so that nurse, though
she was plain and homely in her ways, was of far
more use than a smarter young woman to them&mdash;many
a morning did the little girl, left in the night
nursery in charge of her sleeping brothers, take up
her stand at the window which overlooked Mrs.
Whelan's and the cobbler and the Smileys with all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
their brothers and sisters. There was always something
new to see or to ask nurse to explain afterwards.
For ever so long it took up Peggy's thoughts, and
gave much conversation in the nursery to "plan"
how the ten or eleven children, not to speak of the
papa and mamma, <i>could</i> all find place in two rooms.
It kept Peggy awake at night, especially if the
weather happened to be at all hot or close, to think
how <i>very</i> uncomfortable poor Reddy and Crippley
and Mary-Hann and the Smileys must be, all sleeping
in one bed as nurse said was too probably the
case. And it was the greatest relief to her mind,
and to nurse's too, I do believe, to discover by means
of some cautious inquiries of the cobbler when nurse
took him over some of the boys' boots to mend, that
the family was not so short of space as they had
feared.</p>

<p>"They've two other rooms, Miss Peggy, as doesn't
show to the front," said nurse, "two attics with sloping
windows in the roof to their back again. And
they're striving folk, he says, as indeed any one may
see for theirselves."</p>

<p>"Then how shall we plan it now, I wonder," said
Peggy, looking across to the Smileys' mansion with
new respect. But nurse had already left the room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and perhaps, now she was satisfied their neighbours
were not quite so much to be pitied, would scarcely
have had patience to listen to Peggy's "wonderings"
about them. So the little girl went on to herself&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should think the downstairs room is the
papa's and mamma's and the teeniest baby's, and
perhaps Crippley sleeps there, as she's ill, like me
when I had the hooping-cough and I couldn't sleep
and mamma kept jumping up to me. And then the
big boys and Tip has one room&mdash;'ticks,' nurse calls
the rooms with windows in the roof. I think I'd
like to sleep in a 'tick' room; you must see the
stars so plain without getting up; and&mdash;and&mdash;let
me see, Reddy and Mary-Hann and the Smileys and
the old babies&mdash;no, that's too many&mdash;and I don't
know how many old babies there is. We'll say <i>one</i>&mdash;if
there's another it must be a boy and go in the
boys' tick&mdash;and that makes Reddy and Mary&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Peggy, your mamma's ready for your
lessons," came the housemaid's voice at the door, and
Peggy hurried off. But she was rather in a brown
study at her lessons that morning. Mamma could not
make her out at all, till at last she shut up the
books for a minute and made Peggy tell her where
her thoughts were wool-gathering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so very far away, mamma dear," said Peggy,
laughing. She never could help laughing when
mamma said "funny things like that." "Not so
very far away. I was only wondering about the
children at the back."</p>

<p>She called them always "the children at the
back" when she spoke of them&mdash;for even to mamma
she would have felt shy of telling her own names
for them. And then she went on to repeat what
nurse had heard from the cobbler. Mamma agreed
that it was very interesting, and she too was pleased
to think "the children at the back's house," as
Peggy called it, was more commodious than might
have been expected. But still, even such interesting
things as that must not be allowed to interfere
with lessons, Peggy must put it all out of her head
till they were done with, and then mamma would
talk about it with her.</p>

<p>"Only, mamma," said Peggy, "I don't know what
com&mdash;commo&mdash;that long word you said, means."</p>

<p>"I should not have used it, perhaps," said mamma.
"And yet I don't know. If we only used the words
you understand already, you would never learn new
ones&mdash;eh, Peggy! Commodious just means large,
and not narrow and squeezed up."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Peggy nodded her head, which meant that she
quite understood, and then the lessons went on
smoothly again.</p>

<p>When they were over, mamma talked about poor
people, especially about poor children, to Peggy,
and explained to her more than she had ever done
before about what being poor really means. It
made Peggy feel and look rather sad, and once or
twice mamma was afraid she was going to cry,
which, of course, she did not wish her to do. But
Peggy choked down the crying feeling, because she
knew it would make her mother sorry and would
not do the poor people any good.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she said, "it <i>neely</i> makes me cry, but
I won't. But when I'm big can't I do something
for the children at the back?"</p>

<p>"They won't be children then, Peggy dear. You
may be able to do something for them without
waiting for that. I'll think about it. I don't fancy
they are so <i>very</i> poor. As I have been telling you,
there are many far poorer. But I daresay they have
very few pleasures in their lives. We might try
to think of a little sunshine for them now and then."</p>

<p>"The Smile&mdash;&mdash;" began Peggy, but she stopped
suddenly, growing red&mdash;"the littler ones do play a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
deal in the gutter, mamma dear," she said, anxious
to state things quite fairly; "but I don't think that's
<i>very</i> nice play, and the sun very seldom shines there.
And Red&mdash;the big ones, mamma dear, and the one
that goes on&mdash;I can't remember the name of those
sticks."</p>

<p>"Crutches," said mamma.</p>

<p>"Yes, crutches&mdash;<i>her</i> never has no plays at all, I
don't think. She'd have more sunshine at the
'nother side of our house, mamma dear."</p>

<p>Mamma smiled. Peggy did not understand that
mamma did not mean "sunshine" exactly as she
took it; she forgot, too, that of actual sunshine more
fell on the back street than she thought of. For it
was only on dull or rainy days that she looked out
much on the children at the back. On fine days
her eyes were busy in another direction.</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," said mamma. So Peggy
for the present was satisfied.</p>

<p>This talk about the Smileys and the rest of them
had been a day or two before the morning on which
we first saw Peggy&mdash;the morning that Thor tried so
to make fun of her about choosing sugar in her
bread and milk, because it was cold. Mamma had
not said any more about the children at the back,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and this particular morning Peggy herself was not
thinking very much about them. Her head was
running a good deal on the white cottage and all her
fancies about it, and she was feeling rather disappointed
that she had not succeeded better in amusing
Hal by her stories.</p>

<p>"It must be, I suppose," she said to herself, "that
he's rather too little for that kind of fancy stories.
I wonder if Baldwin would like them; it would be
nice to have somebody to make fancies with me."</p>

<p>But somehow Baldwin and the fairy cottage did
not seem to match. And Thor and Terry were both
much too big&mdash;Thor would laugh at her, and Terry
would think it <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits this word">a</ins> waste of time; he had so many other
things to amuse himself about. No, Peggy could
not think of any one who would "understand," she
decided, with a sigh!</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Just</span> then came the usual summons to her lessons.
Mamma was waiting for her little girl in the corner
of the drawing-room, where she always sat when
she was teaching Peggy. It was a very nice corner,
near the fire, for though it was not winter it was
rather chilly, and mamma often felt cold. Thor
used to tell her that she should take a good run or
have a game of cricket to warm her; it would be
much better than sitting near the fire. Peggy
thought it was rather unkind of Thor to say so, but
mamma only laughed at him, so perhaps it was just
his boy way of speaking.</div>

<p>Peggy said her lessons quite well, but she looked
rather grave; no smiles lighted up her face, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
when lessons were over she sat still without speaking,
and seemed as if she scarcely knew what she
wanted to do with herself.</p>

<p>"Is there anything the matter, dear?" mamma
asked.</p>

<p>"I'm rather tired, I think, mamma," Peggy
replied.</p>

<p>"Tired!" mamma repeated, in some surprise. It
wasn't often that Peggy talked of being tired.
"What is that with? You've not been worrying
yourself about the children who live over Mrs.
Whelan's, I hope? You mustn't do that, you know,
dear; it would do you harm and them no good."</p>

<p>For mamma knew that Peggy sometimes did
"worry" about things&mdash;"Once she takes a thing in
her head she'll work herself up so, for all she seems
so quiet," nurse would say.</p>

<p>"No, mamma dear," Peggy replied; "I'm not
tired because of that. I like thinking about the
children at the back. I wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" said mamma.</p>

<p>"I wish I'd sisters like them. I'm rather lonely,
mamma. I do think God might have gaved <i>one</i>
sister to Peggy, and not such a great lot to the
children at the back."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you have your brothers, my dear little girl.
You might have been an only child."</p>

<p>"The big ones is always neely at school, and
Hal's too little to understand. It's Hal that's tired
me, mamma dear. He was so d'edfully cross afore
nurse put him to bed."</p>

<p>"Cross, was he?" said mamma. "I'm afraid he
must be getting those last teeth. He may be cross
for some time; if so, it would not do to leave him."
She seemed to be speaking to herself, but when she
caught sight of Peggy's puzzled face she stopped.
"Tell me about Hal, dear," she went on. "What
was it that tired you so?"</p>

<p>"I was trying to amuse him and tell him stories
about my white cottage up on the hill, and he was
so cross. He couldn't understand, and he said they
was 'nonsense' stories."</p>

<p>"He is too little, perhaps, to care for fancies," said
her mother, consolingly. "You must wait till he is
a little older, Peggy dear."</p>

<p>"But when he's older he'll be a <i>boy</i>, mamma,"
said Peggy; "he'll be like Thor and Terry, who don't
care for things like that, or Baldwin, who thinks
stories stupid. Oh, mamma, I wish I had a sister.
<i>That's</i> what I want," she added, with conviction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Mamma smiled.</p>

<p>"Poor Peggy," she said. "I'm afraid it can't be
helped. You can never have a sister near your own
age, and I'm afraid a baby sister, even if you had one,
would be no good."</p>

<p>"Oh no, we've had enough babies," said Peggy,
decidedly. "But, mamma, mightn't there be some
little girl who'd play with me like a sister? If there
<i>is</i> a fairy living in that cottage, mamma, how I do
wish she would find a little girl for me!"</p>

<p>Mamma looked a very little bit troubled.</p>

<p>"Peggy dear," she said, "you mustn't let your
fancies run away with you too far. I told you they
would do you no harm if you kept plain in your head
that they <i>were</i> fancies, but you mustn't forget that.
You know there couldn't really be a fairy living in
that little white cottage."</p>

<p>"No," Peggy agreed, "I know that, mamma, because
fairies <i>really</i> live in fairyland."</p>

<p>She looked up gravely into her mother's face
as she said so. Mamma could not help laughing.</p>

<p>"Fairies <i>really</i>," she said, "live in Peggy's funny
little head, and in many other funny little heads, I
have no doubt. But nowhere&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="459" height="700" alt="&quot;Mama dear,&quot; she began...." title="" />
</div>

<p>"Mamma, mamma," Peggy interrupted, putting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
her fingers in her ears as she spoke, "I <i>won't</i> listen.
You mustn't, mustn't say that. I must have my
fairies, mamma. I've no sisters."</p>

<p>"Well, keep them in fairyland then, or at least
only let them out for visits now and then. But don't
mix them up with real things too much, or you will
get quite a confusion, and never be sure if you're
awake or dreaming."</p>

<p>Peggy seemed to consider this over very seriously.
After a minute or too she lifted her face again, and
looked straight into her mother's with her earnest
gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Mamma dear," she began, "will you tell me
what the little white house is <i>reely</i> like, then? If
you will, I'll promise not to think there's fairies
there&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only what, dear?"</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," said Peggy, very anxious not
to hurt her mother's feelings, "I'd <i>rather</i> not have
pigs. I don't think I like pigs very much."</p>

<p>"Well, we needn't have pigs then. But remember
I can only 'fancy' it. I've never seen that particular
cottage, you see, Peggy. But I have seen other
cottages in Brackenshire, and so I can fancy what it
<i>most likely</i> is. You see there are different kinds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
fancying&mdash;there's fancying that is all fancy, like
fairy stories, and there's fancying that might be true
and real, and that very likely is true and real. Do
you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peggy, drawing a deep breath. "Well,
mamma, go on real-fancying, please. What's that
place you've been at&mdash;Brat&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>"Brackenshire," mamma replied. "That's the
name of that part of the country that we see far off,
from the windows upstairs."</p>

<p>"And is all the cottages white there, and is they
<i>very</i> pretty?" asked Peggy, with deep interest. "Oh,
mamma, do tell me, quick."</p>

<p>"I don't know if they're all white, but I think
they are mostly. And there are some pretty and
some ugly. Of course it depends a good deal upon
the people that live in them. If they're nice, clean,
busy people, who like their house to be neat and
pretty, and work hard to keep it so, of course it's
much more likely to be so than if they were careless
and lazy."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Peggy, clasping her hands. "I do so
hope my cottage has nice people living in it. I
<i>think</i> it has, don't you, mamma? It looks <i>so</i> white."</p>

<p>"My dear Peggy," said mamma, smiling, "we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
can't tell, when it's so far away. But we may
hope so."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peggy, "we'll hope so, and we'll
think so." But then a rather puzzled look came over
her face again, though she smiled too. "Mamma,"
she went on, "there's such a funny thing come into
my head, only I don't know quite how to say it. I
think that the far-away helps to make it pretty&mdash;why
is far-away so pretty, mamma?"</p>

<p>Mamma smiled again.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't tell you why. Wouldn't it
spoil some things if we knew the why of them, little
Peggy?"</p>

<p>Peggy did not answer. This was another new
thought for her, and rather a difficult one. She put
it away in her mind, in one of the rather far back
cupboards there, and locked it up, to think about it
afterwards.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she said, coaxingly, "I want you to
tell me a real fancy about the cottage. It will be so
nice when I look at it to think it's most likely <i>reely</i>
like that."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let us see," mamma began.</p>

<p>"Wait just one minute, mamma dear, till I've
shut my eyes. First I must get the bluey hills and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the white spot into them, and then I'll shut them
and see what you tell. Yes&mdash;that's all right now."</p>

<p>So mamma went on.</p>

<p>"I fancy a cottage on the side of a hill. The
cottage is white, of course, and the hill is green. Not
very green&mdash;a kind of brown-green, for the grass is
short and close, nibbled by the sheep and cows that
find their living on the hill most of the year. The
cottage is very white, for last summer it had a nice
wash all over, and that lasts clean a good while in the
country. There is a little low wall round it shutting
it in from the hillside, and this wall is not very white,
though it once was so, for it is covered with creeping
plants, so that you can scarcely see what its own
colour is. At the front of the house there is a little
garden, quite a tiny one&mdash;there are potatoes and
gooseberry bushes and cabbages at one side, but in
front of them are some nice old-fashioned flowers,
and at the other side there are strawberry plants,
and behind them some rose-bushes. In summer I
am sure there will be some pretty roses."</p>

<p>"Oh how nice," said Peggy; "go on, go on, please."</p>

<p>"There is a funny little wooden shed behind the
house, leaning against the wall, which has a door big
enough for a child to go in by, or a big person if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
they stooped down very much, and besides this it has
a <i>very</i> little door in the wall, leading on to the hillside.
Can you guess what the shed is for, Peggy,
and what the tiny door is for?"</p>

<p>Peggy thought and thought, but her country knowledge
was but scanty.</p>

<p>"I can't think," she said. "It couldn't be for
pigs, 'cos there isn't any in the cottage. Nor it
couldn't be for cows, 'cos cows is so big."</p>

<p>"What should you say to cocks and hens, Peggy?
There are to be fresh eggs there, aren't there? And
chickens sometimes. I rather think they take eggs
and chickens to market, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I'm sure they do. How stupid I am!
Of course the little wooden house is for cocks and
hens. You're making it lovelily, mamma. What is
it like inside, and who lives in it? I do so want to
know."</p>

<p>"Inside?" said mamma. "I'm almost afraid you
might be disappointed, Peggy, if you've never been
in a real cottage. There are so many that look very
pretty outside and are not at all pretty inside. But
at least we may think it is neat and clean. There
are only two rooms, Peggy&mdash;a kitchen which you go
straight into, and another room which opens out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
it. The kitchen is very bright and pleasant; there
is a table before the window with some flower-pots
on it, in which both winter and summer there are
plants growing. There is a large cupboard of dark
old wood standing against the wall, and a sort of
sofa that is called a settle with cushions covered
with red cotton, standing near the fireplace. There
are shelves, too, on which stand some dishes and two
or three shining pots and pans, the ugly black ones
are kept in a little back kitchen where most of the
cooking is done, so that the front kitchen should be
kept as nice as possible."</p>

<p>"That makes another room, mamma dear. You
said there was only two."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's so very tiny you couldn't call it a
room. The second room is a bedroom, but the best
pieces of furniture are kept there. There is a nice
chest of drawers and a rocking-chair, and there
is a very funny wooden cradle, standing right
down on the floor, not at all like Baby's cot.
And in this cradle is a nice, fat, bright-eyed little
baby."</p>

<p>"A baby," said Peggy, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure. There's always a baby in a
cottage, unless you'd rather have a very old couple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
whose babies are grown-up men and women, out in
the world."</p>

<p>"No," said Peggy, "I don't want that. A very
old woman in a cottage would be <i>razer</i> like a witch,
or else it could make me think of Red Riding-Hood's
grandmother, and that is <i>so</i> sad. No, I don't mind
the baby if it has a nice mamma&mdash;but only one
baby, pelease, mamma dear. I don't want <i>lots</i>, like
the children at the back, they're always tumbling
about and sc'eaming so."</p>

<p>"Oh no, we won't have it like that. We'll only
have one baby&mdash;a very contented nice baby, and its
mamma is very nice too. She's got quite a pretty
rosy face, and she stands at the door every morning
to see her husband go off to his work, and every
evening to watch for him coming back again, and
she holds the baby up in her arms and it laughs and
crows."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peggy, "that'll do. And the eggs and
the chickens, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, she takes great care of the cocks and
hens, and never forgets to go outside the garden to
feed them on the hill, and in the evening they all
come home of themselves through the little door in
the wall. There's a very nice cat in the cottage too;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
it sits purring on the front steps on fine days, as if it
thought the cottage and garden and everything else
belonged to it. And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But suddenly the clock struck. Up started
mamma.</p>

<p>"Peggy, darling, I had no idea it was so late.
And I have to go out the moment after luncheon,
and I have still two letters to write. I am a greater
baby than any of you! Run off, dear, and tell nurse
I want to speak to her before I go out."</p>

<p>"And to-morrow," said Peggy, "to-morrow, will
you tell me some more about the white cottage,
mamma? It <i>is</i> so nice&mdash;I don't think you're a baby
at all, mamma. A baby couldn't make it up so
lovelily."</p>

<p>And Peggy set off upstairs in great content. The
white spot would give her more pleasure than ever,
now that she knew what sort of <i>real</i> fancies to have
about it.</p>

<p>"And to-morrow," she said to herself, "to-morrow
mamma will tell me more, lots more. If I say my
lessons very goodly, p'raps mamma will tell me some
more every day. And p'raps Hallie would like those
kinds better than about fairies, and wouldn't call
<i>them</i> nonsense stories."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor little Peggy&mdash;"to-morrow" brought news
which put her pretty fancies about the white cottage
out of her head for a while.</p>

<p>She gave her mother's message to nurse, and after
dinner nurse went downstairs. When she came up
again she looked rather grave, and Peggy thought
perhaps she was unhappy about Hal, who was still
cross and had bright red spots on his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Does you think poor Hallie is ill, nurse?"
asked Peggy in a low voice, for Hal not to hear.</p>

<p>"No, my dear, it's only his teeth. But they'll
make him fractious for a while, I'm afraid, and he's
not a very strong child, not near so strong as Baby
and the big boys."</p>

<p>"Poor Hallie," said Peggy, with great sympathy.
"I'll be very good to him even if he is very cross,
nurse."</p>

<p>Nurse did not answer for a minute, and she still
looked very grave.</p>

<p>"Why do you look so sad, nurse, if it isn't about
Hal?" asked Peggy, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Did I look sad, Miss Peggy? I didn't know it.
I was thinking about some things your mamma was
speaking of to me."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Peggy, "was it about our new frocks?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Mamma and you is always very busy when we need
new frocks, I know."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said nurse, but that was all.</p>

<p>Then Peggy and Hal and nurse and Baby went
out for a walk. They did not go very far, for it was
what nurse called a queer-tempered day. Between
the gleams of blue sky and sunshine there came
sharp little storms and showers. It was April
weather, though April had not yet begun.</p>

<p>"Which way are we going?" Peggy asked, as
they set off, she and Hal hand-in-hand, just in front
of nurse and the perambulator. She <i>hoped</i> nurse
would say "up Fernley Road," because Fernley Road
led straight on towards the hills&mdash;so at least it
seemed to Peggy. Their street ran into Fernley
Road at one end, so that Fernley Road was what is
called at right angles with it, and Peggy felt sure
that if you walked far enough along the road you
<i>could</i> not but come to "the beginning of the hills."</p>

<p>But to-day Peggy was to be disappointed.</p>

<p>"We can't go far, Miss Peggy, and we must go to
Field's about Master Hal's new boots. It looks as
if it might rain, so perhaps we'd better go straight
there. You know the way, Miss Peggy?&mdash;right on
to the end of this street and then turn to the left."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Peggy gave a little sigh, but trotted on quietly.
Hal began grumbling.</p>

<p>"What is I to have new boots for?" he said. "I
doesn't want new boots."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hal," said Peggy, "I think it's very nice
indeed to have new boots. They shine so, and sometimes
they do make such a lovely squeaking."</p>

<p>But Hal wasn't in a humour to be pleased with
anything, so Peggy tried to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Nurse says we are to turn to the left at the
end of this street," she said. "Does you know
which is the left, Hal? <i>I</i> do, 'cos of my pocket in
my frock. First I feel for my pocket, and when
it's there I say 'all right,' and then I know that's
the right, and when it isn't there I <i>can't</i> say 'all
right,' and so I know the side it isn't at is the left."</p>

<p>Hal listened with some interest, but a slight tinge
of contempt for feminine garments.</p>

<p>"Boys has pockets at each sides, so all boys' sides
is right," he said.</p>

<p>But Peggy was by this time in the midst of her
researches for her pocket, so she did not argue the
point.</p>

<p>"Here it is!" she exclaimed, "all right, so the
nother side is left. <i>This</i> way, Hallie," and very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
proud to show nurse that she had understood her
directions, she led her little brother down the street
into which they had now turned.</p>

<p>There were shops in this street, which made it
more amusing than the one in which the children
lived, even though they had seen them so often that
they knew pretty well all that was worth looking at
in the windows&mdash;that is to say, in the picture-shops
and the toy-shops, and perhaps in the confectioner's.
All others were passed by as a matter of course.
Field's, the shoemaker's, was not quite so stupid as
some, because under a glass shade, in the midst of
all the real boots and shoes, were half a dozen pairs
of dolls' ones, which Peggy thought quite lovely,
though apparently no one else was of her opinion,
as the tiny things stayed there day after day without
a single pair being sold. Peggy herself could remember
them for what seemed to her a very long
time, and Baldwin, who owned to having admired
them when he was "little," assured her they had
been there since she was quite a baby; he could
remember having "run on" to look at them in the
days when he and Terry had trotted in front and
nurse had perambulated Peggy behind.</p>

<p>The little boots and shoes came into Peggy's mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
just now, partly perhaps because Hal was hanging
back so, and she was afraid he would be cross if she
asked him to walk quicker.</p>

<p>"Let's run on and look at the tiny shoes in
Field's window," she said. "We can wait there till
nurse comes up to us. She'll see us."</p>

<p>This roused Hal to bestir himself, and they were
soon at the shoemaker's.</p>

<p>"<i>Isn't</i> they sweet?" said Peggy. "If I had a
gold pound of my very own, Hal, I'd buy some of
them."</p>

<p>"Would you?" said Hal, doubtfully. "No, if <i>I</i>
had a gold pound I'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But just then nurse came up to them and they
were all marched into the shop.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LITTLE RED SHOES<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
"Pif-paf Pottrie, what trade are you? Are you a tailor?"<br />
"Better still!" "A shoemaker?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;"><span class="smcap">Brothers Grimm.</span></span><br />
<br /></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">There</span> was another reason why the children liked
Field's shop. At the back of it was a sort of little
room railed off by a low wooden partition with curtains
at the top, into which customers were shown
to try on and be fitted with new boots or shoes.
This little room within a room had always greatly
taken Peggy's fancy; she had often talked it over
with her brothers, and wished they could copy it in
their nursery. Inside it had comfortable cushioned
seats all round, making it look like one of the large,
square, cushioned pews still to be found in some old
churches, pews which all children who have ever
sat in them dearly love.</div>

<p>There was always some excitement in peeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
into this little room to see if any one was already
there; if that were the case the children knew they
should have to be "tried on" in the outer shop.
To-day, however, there was no doubt about the
matter&mdash;Miss Field, who acted as her father's shop-woman,
marshalled them all straight into the curtained
recess without delay; there was no one there&mdash;and
when Peggy and Hal had with some difficulty
twisted themselves on to the seats with as much
formality as if they were settling themselves in
church, and nurse had explained what they had
come for, the girl began operations by taking off one
of Hal's boots to serve as a pattern for his size.</p>

<p>"The same make as these, I suppose?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No, miss, a little thicker, I think. They're to
be good strong ones for country wear," said nurse.</p>

<p>Peggy looked up with surprise.</p>

<p>"For the country, nursie," she said. "He'll have
weared them out before it's time for us to go to the
country. It won't be summer for a long while, and
last year we didn't go even when summer comed."</p>

<p>Nurse looked a little vexed. Miss Field, though
smiling and good-natured, was not a special favourite
of nurse's; she was too fond of talking, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
stood there now looking very much amused at
Peggy's remonstrance.</p>

<p>"If you didn't go to the country last year, Miss
Margaret," said nurse, "more reason that you'll go
this. But little girls can't know everything."</p>

<p>Peggy opened her eyes and her mouth. She was
just going to ask nurse what was the matter, which
would not have made things better, I am afraid,
when Baby changed the subject by bursting out
crying. Poor Baby&mdash;he did not like the little
curtained-off room at all; it was rather dark, and
he felt frightened, and as was of course the most
sensible thing to do under the circumstances, as he
could not speak, he cried.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," said nurse, after vainly trying to
soothe him, "he doesn't like being in here, the poor
lamb. He's frightened. I'll never get him quiet
here. Miss Peggy, love," forgetting in her hurry
the presence of Miss Field, for before strangers Peggy
was always "Miss Margaret," with nurse, "I'll have
to put him back in his perambulator at the door,
and if you'll stand beside him he'll be quite content."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 458px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="458" height="700" alt="&quot;Baby did not interrupt her...." title="" />
</div>

<p>And nurse got up as she spoke. Peggy slid herself
down slowly and reluctantly from her seat; she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
would have liked to stay and watch Hal being
fitted with boots, and she would have liked still
more to ask nurse what she meant by speaking of
the country so long before the time, but it was
Peggy's habit to do what she was told without delay,
and she knew she could ask nurse what she wanted
afterwards. So with one regretful look back at the
snug corner where Hal was sitting comfortably
staring at his stockinged toes, she trotted across the
shop to the door where Baby, quite restored to good
humour, was being settled in his carriage.</p>

<p>"There now, he'll be quite happy. Nurse will
come soon, dear. Just let him stay here in the
doorway; he can see all the boots and shoes in the
window&mdash;that will amuse him."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peggy, adding in her own mind that
she would have a good look at the dear, tiny dolls'
ones and fix which she would like to buy if she had
the money.</p>

<p>Baby did not interrupt her; he was quite content
now he was out in the light and the open air, and
amused himself after his own fashion by crowing
and chuckling to the passers-by. So Peggy stood
still, her eyes fixed on the baby shoes. They were
of all colours, black and red and bronze and blue&mdash;it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
was difficult to say which were the prettiest.
Peggy had almost decided upon a red pair, and was
wondering how much money it would take to buy
them, when some one touched her on the shoulder.
She looked up; a lady was standing behind her,
smiling in amusement.</p>

<p>"What are you gazing at so, my dear? Is this
your baby in the perambulator? You had better
wheel him a little bit farther back, or may I do so
for you?&mdash;he has worked himself too far into the
doorway."</p>

<p>Peggy looked up questioningly in the lady's face.
Like many children she did not like being spoken to
by strangers in any unceremonious way; she felt as
if it were rather a freedom.</p>

<p>But the face that met hers was too kind and
bright and pleasant to resist, and though Peggy still
looked grave, it was only that she felt rather shy.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "he's our baby. I was looking
at those sweet little shoes. I didn't see Baby had
pushed hisself away. Thank you," as the lady
gently moved the perambulator a little farther to
one side.</p>

<p>"You and Baby are not alone? Are you waiting
for some one?" she asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nurse is having Hal tried on for new boots,"
Peggy replied, "and Baby didn't like the shop 'cos
it were rather dark."</p>

<p>"And so his kind little sister is taking care of
him. I see," said the lady. "And what are the
sweet little shoes you like so much to look at?
Are they some that would fit Baby?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Peggy, "they'd be too little for
him. Baby <i>is</i> rather fat. Oh no, it's <i>those</i> under
the glass basin turned upside down," and she pointed
to the dolls' shoes. "Aren't they lovely? I've seen
them ever since I was quite little&mdash;I suppose they'd
cost a great lot," and Peggy sighed.</p>

<p>"Which do you think the prettiest?" asked the
lady.</p>

<p>"The red ones," Peggy replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I almost think I agree with you," said the
lady. "Good-bye, my dear, don't let Baby run
himself out into the street." And with a kind smile
she went on into the shop.</p>

<p>She passed back again in a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Still there?" she said, nodding to Peggy, and
then she made her way down the street and was
soon out of sight. Peggy's attention, since the lady
had warned her, had been entirely given to Baby,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
otherwise she might perhaps have noticed a very
wonderful thing that had happened in the shop-window.
The pair of red dolls' shoes was no longer
there! They had been quietly withdrawn from the
case in which they, with their companions, had spent
a peaceful, but it must be allowed a rather dull life
for some years.</p>

<p>In another minute nurse and Hal made their
appearance, and Hal had a parcel, which he was
clutching tightly in both hands.</p>

<p>"My new boots is <i>so</i> shiny," he said, "I do so
hope they'll squeak. Does you think they will,
nursie? But isn't poor Peggy to have new boots,
too? <i>Poor</i> Peggy!"</p>

<p>Peggy looked down at her feet.</p>

<p>"Mine isn't wored out yet," she said; "it would
take all poor mamma's money to buy new boots for
us <i>all</i>."</p>

<p>"Never fear," said nurse, who heard rather a
martyr tone in Peggy's voice, "you'll not be forgotten,
Miss Peggy. But Master Hal, hadn't you
better put your boots in the perambulator? You'll
be tired of carrying them, for we're not going straight
home."</p>

<p>Hal looked as if he were going to grumble at this,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
but before he had time to say anything, Miss Field
came hurrying out of the shop.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're still here," she said; "that's all right.
The lady who's just left told father to give this little
parcel to missie here," and she held out something
to Peggy, who was so astonished that for a moment
or two she only stared at the girl without offering to
take the tiny packet.</p>

<p>"For me," she said at last.</p>

<p>"Yes, missie, to be sure&mdash;for you, as I say."</p>

<p>Peggy took the parcel, and began slowly to undo it.
Something red peeped out&mdash;Peggy's eyes glistened&mdash;then
her cheeks grew nearly as scarlet as the contents
of the packet, and she seemed to gasp for breath, as
she held out for Hal and nurse to see the little red
shoes which five minutes before she had been admiring
under the glass shade.</p>

<p>"Nursie, Hal," she exclaimed, "see, oh see! The
sweet little shoes&mdash;for me&mdash;for my very own."</p>

<p>Nurse was only too ready to be pleased, but with
the prudence of a "grown-up" person she hesitated
a moment.</p>

<p>"Are you sure there's no mistake, miss?" she
said, anxiously. "Do you know the lady's name?
Is she a friend of Missis's, I wonder?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"Can't say, I'm sure," she replied. "She's a
stranger to us. She only just bought a pair of cork
soles and these here. There's no mistake, that, I'm
sure of. She must have seen the young lady was
admiring of them."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peggy, "she asked me which was the
prettiest, and I said the red ones."</p>

<p>"You see?" said Miss Field to nurse. "Well,
missie, I hope as they'll fit Miss Dolly, and then
you'll give us your custom when they're worn out,
won't you?"</p>

<p>And with a good-natured laugh she turned back
into the shop.</p>

<p>"It's all right, nursie, isn't it? Do say it is.
I may keep them; they <i>is</i> mine, isn't they?" said
Peggy, in very unusual excitement.</p>

<p>Nurse still looked undecided.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know what to say, my dear," she
replied. "We must ask your mamma. I shouldn't
think she'd object, seeing as it was so kindly meant.
And we can't give back the shoes now they're bought
and paid for. It wouldn't be fair to the lady to
give them back to Field just to be sold again. It
wasn't <i>him</i> she wanted to give a present to."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Peggy, trotting along beside the perambulator
and clasping her little parcel as Hal was
clasping his bigger one, "it was <i>me</i> she wanted to
please. She's a <i>very</i> kind lady, isn't she, nursie?
I'm sure they cost a great lot of money&mdash;p'raps a
pound. Oh! I do so hope mamma will say I may
keep them for my very own. Can't we go home
now this minute to ask her?"</p>

<p>"We shouldn't find her in if we did," said nurse,
"and we've had nothing of a walk so far. But don't
you worry, Miss Peggy. I'm sure your mamma will
not mind."</p>

<p>Peggy's anxious eager little face calmed down at
this; a corner of the paper in which her treasures
were wrapped up was torn. She saw the scarlet
leather peeping out, and a gleam of delight danced
out of her eyes; she bent her head down and kissed
the speck of bright colour ecstatically, murmuring
to herself as she did so, "Oh, how happy I am!"</p>

<p>Nurse overheard the words.</p>

<p>"Missis will never have the heart to take them
from her, poor dear," she thought. "She'll be only
too pleased for Miss Peggy to have something to
cheer her up when she has to be told about our
going."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>And Peggy, in blissful ignorance of any threatening
cloud to spoil her pleasure, marched on, scarcely
feeling the ground beneath her feet; as happy as if
the tiny red shoes had been a pair of fairy ones to
fit her own little feet.</p>

<p>Mamma was not at home when they got in, even
though they made a pretty long round, coming back
by Fernley Road, which, however, Peggy did not
care about as much as when they set off by it. For
coming back, of course she could not see the hills
without turning round, nor could she have the feeling
that every step was taking her nearer to them.
The weather was clearing when they came in; from
the nursery window the sky towards the west had
a faint flush upon it, which looked as if the sunset
were going to be a rosy one.</p>

<p>"Red at night," Peggy said to herself as she
glanced out; "nursie, that means a fine day, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>"So they say," nurse replied.</p>

<p>"Then it'll be a fine day to-morrow, and I'll see
the cottage, and I'll put the little shoes on the
window-sill, so that they shall see it too&mdash;the <i>dear</i>
little sweets," chattered the child to herself.</p>

<p>Hal meanwhile was seated on the floor, engaged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in a more practical way, namely, <i>trying</i> to try on his
new boots. But "new boots," as he said himself,
"is stiff." Hal pulled and tugged till he grew very
red in the face, but all in vain.</p>

<p>"Oh, Peggy!" he said, "do help me. I does so
want to hear them squeak, and to 'upprise the boys
when they come in."</p>

<p>Down went kind Peggy on the floor, and thanks
to her the boots were got on, though the buttoning of
them was beyond her skill. Hal was quite happy, though.</p>

<p>"They do squeak, don't they, Peggy?" he said;
"and nurse'll let me wear them a little for them to
get used to my feet 'afore we go to the country."</p>

<p>"You mean for your feet to get used to them,
Hallie," said Peggy. "But there's lots of time for
that. Why, they'll be half wored out before we go
to the country if you begin them now."</p>

<p>"'Tisn't nonsense," said Hal, sturdily. "Nurse
said so to that girl in the shop."</p>

<p>Peggy felt very puzzled.</p>

<p>"But, Hal," she was beginning, when a voice
interrupted her. It was nurse. She had been downstairs,
having heard the front door bell ring.</p>

<p>"Miss Peggy, your mamma wants you. She's
come in. You'll find her in her own room."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nursie," she said, "Hal's been saying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mustn't keep your mamma waiting," said
nurse. "I've told her about the little shoes."</p>

<p>"I'll take them to show her&mdash;won't she be
pleased?" said Peggy, seizing the little parcel which
she had put down while helping Hal.</p>

<p>And off she set.</p>

<p>She stopped at her mother's door; it was only
half shut, so she did not need to knock.</p>

<p>"Mamma dear, it's me&mdash;Peggy," she said.</p>

<p>"Come in, darling," mamma's voice replied.</p>

<p>"I've brought you the <i>sweet</i> little red shoes to
see," said Peggy, carefully unfolding the paper which
held her treasures, and holding them out for mamma's
admiration.</p>

<p>"They are very pretty indeed&mdash;really lovely little
shoes," she said, handling them with care, but so as
to see them thoroughly. "It was <i>very</i> kind of that
lady. I wonder who she was? Of course in a
general way I wouldn't like you to take presents
from strangers, but she must have done it in such a
very nice way. Was she an old lady, Peggy?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" said Peggy, "quite old. She was
neely as big as you, mamma dear. I daresay she's
<i>neely</i> as old as you are."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Mamma began to laugh.</p>

<p>"You little goose," she said. But Peggy didn't
see anything to laugh at in what she had said, and
her face remained quite sober.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, mamma dear," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, listen then; didn't Hal buy a pair of new
boots for himself to-day?" mamma began.</p>

<p>"No, mamma dear. Nurse buyed them <i>for</i> he,"
Peggy replied.</p>

<p>"Or rather <i>I</i> bought them, for it was my money
nurse paid for them with, if you are so very precise,
Miss Peggy. But never mind about that. All I
want you to understand is the difference between
'big' and 'old.' Hal's boots are much bigger than
these tiny things, but they are not on that account
<i>older</i>."</p>

<p>Peggy began to laugh.</p>

<p>"No, mamma dear. P'raps Hallie's boots is
younger than my sweet little red shoes, for they
has been a great long while in the shop window, and
Baldwin and Terry sawed them when they was
little."</p>

<p>"Not 'younger,' Peggy dear; 'newer,' you mean.
Boots aren't alive. You only speak of live things
as 'young.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Peggy sighed.</p>

<p>"It is rather difficult to understand, mamma
dear."</p>

<p>"It will all come by degrees," said mamma.
"When I was a little girl I know I thought for a
long time that the moon was the mamma of the
stars, because she looked so much bigger."</p>

<p>"I think that's very nice, mamma, though, of
course, I understand it's only a <i>fancy</i> fancy. I
haven't seen the moon for a long time, mamma.
May I ask nurse to wake me up the next time the
moon comes?"</p>

<p>"You needn't wait till dark to see the moon,"
said mamma. "She can often be seen by daylight,
though, of course, she doesn't look so pretty then, as
in the dark sky which shows her off better. But, of
course, the sky here is so often dull with the smoke
of the town that we can't see her as clearly in the
daytime as where the air is purer."</p>

<p>"Like in the country, mamma," said Peggy.
"It's <i>always</i> clear in the country, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not quite always," said mamma, smiling. "But,
Peggy dear, speaking of the country&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" Peggy interrupted, "I want to tell
you, mamma, what a silly thing Hallie <i>would</i> say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
about going to the country;" and she told her mother
all that Hal had said about his boots, and indeed what
nurse had said too; "and nursie was just a weeay,
teeny bit cross to me, mamma dear," said Peggy,
plaintively. "She wouldn't say she'd mistooked
about it."</p>

<p>Mamma looked rather grave, and instead of saying
at once that of course nurse had only meant
that Hal's boots should last till the summer, she
took Peggy on her knee and kissed her&mdash;kissed her
in rather a "funny" way, thought Peggy, so that she
looked up and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mamma dear, why do you kiss me like that?"</p>

<p>Instead of answering, mamma kissed her again,
which almost made Peggy laugh.</p>

<p>But mamma was not laughing.</p>

<p>"My own little Peggy," she said, "I have something
to tell you which I am afraid will make you
unhappy. It is making <i>me</i> very unhappy, I know."</p>

<p>"Poor dear little mamma," said Peggy, and as
she spoke she put up her little hand and stroked
her mother's face. "Don't be unhappy if it isn't
anything <i>very</i> bad. Tell Peggy about it, mamma
dear."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FELLOW-FEELINGS AND SLIPPERS<br /><br /></div>

"If I'd as much money as I could tell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I never would cry 'old clothes to sell'!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;"><i>London Cries.</i></span><br />
<br /></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Mamma</span> hesitated a moment. Then she began.</div>

<p>"You know, Peggy, my pet," she said, "for a good
while now I haven't been as strong and well as I
used to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, mamma, stop," said Peggy, with a sort of
cry, and as she spoke she threw up her hands and
pressed them hard against her ears; "I know what
you're going to say, but I can't bear it, no, I can't.
Oh mamma, you're not to say you're going to die."</p>

<p>For all answer mamma caught Peggy into her
arms and kissed her again and again. For a minute
or two it seemed as if she could not speak, but at
last she got her voice. And then, rather to Peggy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
surprise, she saw that although there were tears in
mamma's eyes, and even one or two trickling down
her face, she was smiling too.</p>

<p>"My darling Peggy," she said, "did I frighten
you? I am so, so sorry. Oh no, darling, it is nothing
like that. Please God I shall live to see my Peggy
as old as I am now, and older, I hope. No, no, dear,
it is nothing so very sad I was going to tell you. It
is only that the doctor says the best way for me to
get quite well and strong again is to go away for a
while to have change of air as it is called, in some
nice country place."</p>

<p>"In the country," said Peggy, her eyes brightening
with pleasure. "Oh, how nice! will it perhaps be
that country where my cottage is? Oh, dear mamma,
how lovely! And when are we to go? May we
begin packing to-day? And how could you think it
would make me unhappy&mdash;&mdash;" she went on, suddenly
remembering what her mother had said at first.</p>

<p>Mamma's face did not brighten up at all.</p>

<p>"Peggy dear, it is very hard for me to tell you,"
she said. "Of course, if we had all been going together
it would have been only happy. But that's
just the thing. I can't take you with me, my sweet.
Baby must go, because nurse must, and Hallie too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
But the friend I am going to stay with can't have
more of us than the two little ones, and nurse, and
me&mdash;it is very, very good of her to take so many."</p>

<p>"Couldn't I sleep with you, mamma dear?" said
Peggy in a queer little voice, the tone of which went
to mamma's heart.</p>

<p>"My pet, Hallie must sleep with me, as it is. My
friend's house isn't very big. And there's another
reason why I can't take you&mdash;I'm not sure if you
could understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell it me, please, mamma."</p>

<p>"The lady I am going to had a little girl just like
you&mdash;I mean just the same age, and rather like you
altogether, I think. And the poor little girl died
two years ago, Peggy. Since then it is a pain to her
mother to see other little girls. When you are
bigger and not so like what her little girl was, I
daresay she won't mind."</p>

<p>Peggy had been listening, her whole soul in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I understand," she said. "I wouldn't like to go
if it would make that lady cry&mdash;if it hadn't been for
that&mdash;oh mamma, I could have squeezed myself up
so very tight in the bed! You and Hallie wouldn't
have knowed I were there. But I wouldn't like to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
make her cry. I am so sorry about that little girl.
Mamma, how is it that dying is so nice, about going
to heaven, you know, and <i>still</i> it is so sorry?"</p>

<p>"There is the parting," said mamma.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that must be it. And, mamma, I hope it
isn't naughty, but if you were to die I'd be <i>very</i> sorry
not to see you again just the same&mdash;even if you were
to be a very pretty angel, with shiny clothes and all
that, I'd want you to be my own old mamma."</p>

<p>"I would be your own old mamma, dear. I am
sure you would feel I was the same."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," said Peggy. "Still it is sad to
die," and she sighed. "Mamma dear, you won't
be very long away, will you? It'll only be a little
short parting, won't it?"</p>

<p>"Only a few weeks, dear. And I hope you won't
be unhappy even though you must be a little
lonely."</p>

<p>"If only I had a sister," said Peggy.</p>

<p>But mamma went on to tell her all she had
planned. Miss Earnshaw, a dressmaker who used
sometimes to come and sew, was to be with Peggy as
much as she could. She was a gentle nice girl, and
Peggy liked her.</p>

<p>"She has several things to make for me just now,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
said mamma, "and as she lives near, she will try to
come every day, so that she will be with you at
dinner and tea. And Fanny will help you to dress
and undress, and either she or Miss Earnshaw will
take you a walk every day that it is fine enough.
And then in the evenings, of course, the boys will
be at home, and papa will see you every morning
before he goes."</p>

<p>"And I daresay he'll come up to see me in bed at
night too," said Peggy. Then she was silent for a
minute or two; the truth was, I think, that she was
trying hard to swallow down a lump in her throat
that <i>would</i> come, and to blink away two or three
tiresome tears that kept creeping up to her eyes.</p>

<p>Two days later and they were gone. Mamma,
nurse, Hal, and Baby, with papa to see them off, and
two boxes outside the cab, and of course a whole lot
of smaller packages inside.</p>

<p>Peggy stood at the front-door, nodding and kissing
her hand and making a smile, as broad a one as she
possibly could, to show that she was not crying.</p>

<p>When they were gone, really gone, and Fanny
had shut the door, she turned kindly to Peggy.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Peggy, love, what will you do? Miss
Earnshaw won't be here till to-morrow. I'll try to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
be ready so as to take you out this afternoon if it's
fine, for it's not a half-holiday. It'd be very dull
for you all day alone&mdash;to-morrow the young gentlemen
will be at home as it's Saturday."</p>

<p>A bright idea struck Peggy.</p>

<p>"Fanny," she said, "did mamma or nurse say
anything about soap-bubbles?"</p>

<p>Fanny shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, miss. But I'm sure there'd be no objection
to your playing at them if you liked. I can easy
get a little basin and some soap and water for you.
But have you a pipe?"</p>

<p>Peggy shook her head.</p>

<p>"It isn't for me, Fanny, thank you," she said.
"It's for my brothers most. I'd like to make a surprise
for them while mamma's away."</p>

<p>"Yes, that would be very nice," said Fanny,
who had been charged at all costs to make
Peggy happy. "We'll talk about it. But I'd better
get on with my work, so as to get out a bit this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Very well. I'll go up to the nursery," said the
little girl.</p>

<p>The nursery seemed very strange. Peggy had
never seen it look quite so empty. Not only were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
nurse and the little ones gone, but it seemed as if
everything belonging to them had gone too, for nurse
had sat up late the night before and got up very
early this same morning to put everything into
perfect order before leaving. The tidiness was quite
unnatural. Peggy sat down in a corner and gave a
deep sigh. Just then she did not even care to turn
to the window, where the sunshine was pouring in
brightly, sparkling on the two little scarlet shoes,
standing side by side on the sill, where Peggy placed
them every fine morning, that they might enjoy the
sight of the white cottage on the hill!</p>

<p>"I almost wish it was raining," she half whispered
to herself, till she remembered how very disagreeable
a wet day would have been for mamma and the
others to travel on. "I hope it will be a sunny day
when they come back," she added, as a sort of make-up
for her forgetfulness.</p>

<p>And then she got up and wandered into the other
room. Here one of Hal's old shoes, which had fallen
out of a bundle of things to be given away which
nurse had taken downstairs just before going, was
lying on the floor. Peggy stooped and picked it up.
How well she knew the look of Hal's shoes; there
was the round bump of his big toe, and the hole at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the corner where a bit of his red sock used to peep
out! It gave her a strange dreamy feeling as she
looked at it. It seemed as if it could not be true
that Hallie was far away&mdash;"far, far away" by this
time, thought Peggy, for she always felt as if the
moment people were in the railway they were whizzed
off hundreds of miles in an instant. She stroked the
poor old shoe lovingly and kissed it. I don't think
just then she would have parted with it for anything;
it would have cost her less to give away the
lovely little scarlet ones.</p>

<p>The thought of the old clothes turned her mind
to the children at the back.</p>

<p>"I wonder if nurse gave them any of Hal's and
Baby's old things," she said to herself.</p>

<p>And she went to the window with a vague idea of
looking to see. She had not watched the Smileys
or their relations much for some days; she had been
busy helping mamma and nurse in various little
ways, and her mind had been very full of the going
away. She almost felt as if she had neglected her
opposite neighbours, though, of course, they knew
nothing about it, and she was quite pleased to see
them all there as usual, or even more than usual.
For it was so fine a day that Reddy and her mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
were evidently having a grand turn-out&mdash;a sort of
spring cleaning, I suppose.</p>

<p>Small pieces of carpet, and one or two mats, much
the worse for wear, were hanging out at the open
windows. Reddy's head, tied up in a cloth to keep
the dust out of her hair, was to be seen every minute
or two, as she thumped about with a long broom,
and Mary-Hann presently appeared with a pail of
soapy water which she emptied at a grid in the
gutter. Mary-Hann looked rather depressed, but
Reddy's spirits were fully equal to the occasion.
Had the window been open, Peggy felt sure she
would have been able to hear her shouting to her
sister to "look sharp," or to "mind what she was
about," even more vigorously than usual.</p>

<p>The rest of the family, excepting, of course, the
boys, were assembled on the pavement in front of
Mr. Crick the cobbler's shop. He too had opened
his window to enjoy the fine day, and in the background
he could be dimly seen working, as dingy
and leathery as ever. Mrs. Whelan's frilled cap and
pipe looked out for a moment and then disappeared
again. Apparently just then there was nobody or
nothing she <i>could</i> scold.</p>

<p>For the poor children on the pavement were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
behaving very quietly. The Smileys had stayed at
home from school to mind the babies, with a view
to smoothing the way for the spring cleaning, no
doubt, and were sitting, each with a child on her
lap, in two little old chairs they had carried down.
Crippley was rocking herself gently in her chair
beside them, and the last baby but two, as Peggy
then thought, was on his knees on the ground,
amusing himself with two or three oyster shells and a
few marbles. All these particulars Peggy, from her
high-up nursery window, could not, of course, see
clearly, but she saw enough to make her sigh deeply
as she thought that after all, the Smileys were much
to be envied.</p>

<p>"I daresay they're telling theirselves stories," she
said to herself. "They look so comfable."</p>

<p>Just then the big baby happened to come more in
sight, and she saw that one of the things he was
playing with was a little shoe&mdash;an odd one apparently.
He had filled it with marbles, and was pulling
it across the stones. Up jumped Peggy from
her seat on the window-sill.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, though there was no one
to hear, "it must be the nother shoe of this. What
a pity! They'd do for Tip, and p'raps they've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
thought there wasn't a nother. How I would like
to take it them! I'll call Fanny and see if she'll
run across with it."</p>

<p>Downstairs she went, calling Fanny from time to
time as she journeyed. But no Fanny replied; she
was down in the kitchen, and to the kitchen Peggy
knew mamma would not like her to go. She stood
at last in the passage wondering what to do, when,
glancing round, she noticed that the back-door opening
into the yard was temptingly open. Peggy
peeped out&mdash;there was no one there, but, still more
tempting, the door leading into the small back street&mdash;the
door just opposite the Smiley mansion&mdash;stood
open, wide open too, and even from where she was
the little girl could catch sight of the group on the
other side of the narrow street.</p>

<p>She trotted across the yard, and stood for a
minute, the shoe in her hand, gazing at the six
children. The sound of their voices reached her.</p>

<p>"Halfred is quite took up with his shoe," said
Brown Smiley. "I told mother she moight as well
give it he&mdash;a hodd shoe's no good to nobody."</p>

<p>"'Tis a pity there wasn't the two of 'em," said
Crippley, in a thin, rather squeaky voice. "They'd a
done bee-yutiful for&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="459" height="700" alt="&#39;&quot;For Tip&mdash;yes, that&#39;s what I were thinking,&quot; cried an eager little voice...." title="" />
</div>

<p>"For Tip&mdash;yes, that's what <i>I</i> were thinking,"
cried an eager little voice. "Here's the other shoe;
I've just founded it."</p>

<p>And little Peggy, with her neat hair and clean
pinafore, stood in the middle of the children holding
out Hal's slipper, and smiling at them, like an old
friend.</p>

<p>For a moment or two they were all too astonished
to speak; they could scarcely have stared more had
they caught sight of a pair of wings on her shoulders,
by means of which she had flown down from the
sky.</p>

<p>Then Light Smiley nudged Crippley, and murmured
something which Peggy could not clearly hear,
about "th' young lady hopposite."</p>

<p>"Thank you, miss," then said Crippley, not quite
knowing what to say. "Here, Halfred, you'll have
to find summat else to make a carridge of; give us
the shoe&mdash;there's a good boy."</p>

<p>Halfred stopped playing, and still on his knees
on the pavement stared up suspiciously at his sister.
Brown Smiley, by way of taking part in what was
going on, swooped down over him and caught up the
shoe before he saw what she was doing, cleverly
managing to hold her baby on her knee all the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Ere it be," she said. "Sarah, put Florence on
Lizzie's lap for a minute, and run you upstairs with
them two shoes to mother. They'll do splendid for
Tommy, they will. And thank the young lady."</p>

<p>Sarah, otherwise Light Smiley, got up obediently,
deposited <i>her</i> baby on Crippley's lap and held out
her hand to Peggy for the other shoe, bobbing as she
did so, with a "Thank you, miss."</p>

<p>Peggy left off smiling and looked rather puzzled.</p>

<p>"For Tommy," she repeated. "Who is Tommy?
I thought they'd do for Tip. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was now the sisters' turn to stare, but they had
not much time to do so, for Halfred, who had taken
all this time to arrive at the knowledge that his new
plaything had been taken from him, suddenly burst
into a loud howl&mdash;so loud, so deliberate and determined,
that Peggy stopped short, and all the group
seemed for a moment struck dumb.</p>

<p>Brown Smiley was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Come, now, Halfred," she said, "where's your
manners? You'd never stop Tommy having a nice
pair o' shoes."</p>

<p>But Halfred continued to weep&mdash;he gazed up at
Peggy, the tears streaming down his smutty face, his
mouth wide open, howling hopelessly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor little boy," said Peggy, looking ready to
cry herself. "I wish I'd a nother old shoe for him."</p>

<p>"Bless you, miss, he's always a-crying&mdash;there's no
need to worry," said Crippley, whose real name was
Lizzie. "Take him in with you, Sarah, and tell
mother he's a naughty boy, that's what he is," and
Light Smiley picked him up and ran off with him in
such a hurry that Peggy stood still repeating "poor
little boy" before she knew what had become of him.</p>

<p>Quiet was restored, however. Peggy, having
done what she came for, should have gone home, but
the attractions of society were too much for her.
She lingered&mdash;Crippley pushed Sarah's empty chair
towards her.</p>

<p>"Take a seat, miss," she said. "You'll excuse
me not gettin' up. Onst I'm a-sittin' down, it's not
so heasy."</p>

<p>Peggy looked at her with great interest.</p>

<p>"Does it hurt much?" she asked.</p>

<p>Lizzie smiled in a superior way.</p>

<p>"Bless you," she said again, "<i>hurt's</i> no word for
it. It's hall over&mdash;but it's time I were used to it&mdash;never
mind about me, missy. I'm sure it was most
obligin' of you to bring the shoe, but won't your
mamma and your nurse scold you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"My mamma's gone away, and so has my nurse,"
said Peggy. "I'm all alone."</p>

<p>All the eyes looked up with sympathy.</p>

<p>"Deary me, who'd a thought it?" said Brown
Smiley. "But there must be somebody to do for
you, miss."</p>

<p>"To what?" asked Peggy. "Of course there's
cook, and Fanny, and my brothers, and my papa when
he comes home."</p>

<p>Brown Smiley looked relieved. She was only a
very little girl, not more than three years older than
Peggy herself, though she seemed so much more, and
she had really thought that the little visitor meant
to say she was quite, quite by herself.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, "that's not being real alone."</p>

<p>"But it is," persisted Peggy. "It is very alone, I
can tell you. I've nobody to play with, and nothing
to do 'cept to look out of the window at you playing,
and at the nother window at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The winder to the front," said Lizzie, eagerly.
"It must be splendid at your front, miss. Father
told me onst you could see the 'ills&mdash;ever so far right
away in Brackenshire. Some day if I could but
get along a bit better I'd like fine to go round to
your front, miss. I've never seed a 'ill."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Lizzie was quite out of breath with excitement.
Peggy answered eagerly,</p>

<p>"Oh I do wish you could come to our day nursery
window. When it's fine you can see the mountings&mdash;that's
old, no, big hills, you know. And&mdash;on one
of them you can see a white cottage; it does so
shine in the sun."</p>

<p>"Bless me," said Lizzie, and both the Smileys,
for Sarah had come back by now, stood listening with
open mouths.</p>

<p>"Father's from Brackenshire," said Light Smiley,
whose real name was Sarah. She spoke rather
timidly, for she was well kept in her place by her
four elder sisters. For a wonder they did not snub
her.</p>

<p>"Yes, he be," added Matilda, "and he's told us it's
bee-yutiful over there. He lived in a cottage, he did,
when he were a little lad."</p>

<p>"Mebbe 'tis father's cottage miss sees shining,"
ventured Sarah. But this time she was not so
lucky.</p>

<p>"Rubbish, Sarah," said Lizzie. "There's more'n
one cottage in Brackenshire."</p>

<p>"And there's a mamma and a baby&mdash;and a papa
who goes to work, in my cottage," said Peggy. "So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
I don't think it could be&mdash;&mdash;" but here she grew
confused, remembering that all about the white
cottage was only fancy, and that besides the Smileys'
father <i>might</i> have lived there long ago. She got
rather red, feeling somehow as if it was not very kind
of her not to like the idea of its being his cottage.
She had seen him once or twice; he looked big and
rough, and his clothes were old&mdash;she could not fancy
him ever having lived in her dainty white house.</p>

<p>Just then came a loud voice from the upper story,
demanding Sarah.</p>

<p>"'Tis Mother Whelan," said Brown Smiley, starting
up. "Rebecca said as how I was to run of an
errant for her. It's time I were off."</p>

<p>Peggy turned to go.</p>

<p>"I must go home," she said. "P'raps I'll come
again some day. If mamma was at home I'd ask
her if you mightn't come to look out of the nursery
window," she added, turning to Lizzie.</p>

<p>"Bless you," said the poor girl, "I'd never get up
the stairs; thank you all the same."</p>

<p>And with a deep sigh of regret at having to leave
such pleasant company, Peggy ran across the street
home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A BUN TO THE GOOD<br /><br /></div>

<div class='center'>
"The little gift from out our store."<br />
<br /></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> yard door was still open; so was the house door.
Peggy met no one as she ran in.</div>

<p>"Fanny's upstairs, p'raps," she said to herself.
But no, she saw nothing of Fanny either on the way
up or in the nursery. She did not feel dull or lonely
now, however. She went to the back window and
stood there for a minute looking at Crippley and Light
Smiley, who were still there with the two babies.
How funny it seemed that just a moment or two ago
she had been down there actually talking to them!
She could scarcely believe they were the very same
children whom for so long she had known by sight.</p>

<p>"I am so glad I found the shoe," thought Peggy.
"I wish, oh I do wish I could have a tea-party, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
'avite them all to tea. I daresay the father could
carry Crippley upstairs&mdash;he's a very big man."</p>

<p>The thought of the father carried her thoughts
to Brackenshire and the cottage on the hill, and she
went into the day-nursery to look if the white spot
was still to be seen. Yes, it was very bright and
clear in the sunshine. Peggy gazed at it while a
smile broke over her grave little face.</p>

<p>"How I do wish I could go there," she thought.
"I wonder if the Smileys' father 'amembers about
when he was a little boy, quite well. If he wasn't
such a 'nugly man we might ask him to tell us stories
about it."</p>

<p>Then she caught sight of the little scarlet shoes
patiently standing on the window-sill.</p>

<p>"Dear little shoes," she said. "Peggy was neely
forgetting you," and she took them up and kissed
them. "Next time I go to see the Smileys," she
thought, "I'll take the red shoes with me to show
them. They <i>will</i> be pleased."</p>

<p>Then she got out her work and sat down to do it,
placing her chair where she could see the hills from,
the little shoes in her lap, feeling quite happy and
contented. It seemed but a little while till Fanny
came up to lay the cloth for Peggy's dinner. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
had been working extra hard that morning, so as to
be ready for the afternoon, and perhaps her head was
a little confused. And so when Peggy began telling
her her adventures she did not listen attentively, and
answered "yes" and "no" without really knowing
what she was saying.</p>

<p>"And so when I couldn't find you, Fanny, I just
runned over with the 'nother shoe myself. And the
poor little boy what was playing with the&mdash;the <i>not</i>
the 'nother one, you know, did so cry, but I think
he soon left off. And some day I'm going to ask
mamma to let me 'avite them all to tea, for them to
see the hills, and&mdash;&mdash;" but here Peggy stopped, "the
hills, you know, out of the window."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; very nice," said Fanny. "You've
been a good little girl to amuse yourself so quietly
all the morning and give no trouble. I do wonder
if the washerwoman knows to come for the nursery
things, or if I must send," she went on, speaking,
though aloud, to herself.</p>

<p>So Peggy felt perfectly happy about all she had
done, not indeed that she had had the slightest
misgiving.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed very pleasantly. It was
quite a treat to Peggy to go a walk in a grown-up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
sort of way with Fanny, trotting by her side and
talking comfortably, instead of having to take Hal's
hand and lugging him along to keep well in front of
the perambulator. They went up the Ferndale Road&mdash;a
good way, farther than Peggy had ever been&mdash;so
far indeed that she could scarcely understand how it
was the hills did not seem much nearer than from
the nursery window, but when she asked Fanny,
Fanny said it was often so with hills&mdash;"nothing is
more undependable." Peggy did not quite understand
her, but put it away in her head to think
about afterwards.</p>

<p>And when they came home it was nearly tea-time.
Peggy felt quite comfortably tired when she
had taken off her things and began to help Fanny to
get tea ready for the boys, and when they arrived,
all three very hungry and rather low-spirited at the
thought of mamma and nurse being away, it was
very nice for them to find the nursery quite as tidy
as usual&mdash;indeed, perhaps, rather tidier&mdash;and Peggy,
with a bright face, waiting with great pride to pour
out tea for them.</p>

<p>"I think you're a very good housekeeper, Peg,"
said Terence, who was always the first to say something
pleasant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so bad," agreed Thorold, patronisingly.</p>

<p>Baldwin sat still, looking before him solemnly,
and considering his words, as was his way before <i>he</i>
said anything.</p>

<p>"I think," he began at last, "I think that when
I'm a big man I'll live in a cottage all alone with
Peggy, and not no one else."</p>

<p>Peggy turned to him with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"A <i>white</i> cottage, Baldwin dear; do say a white
cottage," she entreated.</p>

<p>"I don't mind&mdash;a white cottage, but quite a tiny
one," he replied.</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Thor, "that's very good-natured, I
must say. There'll be no room for visitors, do you
hear, Terry?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; p'raps there will sometimes," said
Peggy.</p>

<p>"You'll let your poor old Terry come, won't you,
Peg-top?" said Terence, coaxingly.</p>

<p>"Dear Terry," said Peggy.</p>

<p>"Haven't you been very dull all day alone, by
the bye?" Terence went on.</p>

<p>"Not very," Peggy replied. "Fanny took me a
nice walk, and this morning&mdash;&mdash;" But she stopped
short before telling more. She was afraid that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Thorold would laugh at her if she said how much
she liked the children at the back, and then she
had another reason. She wanted to "surprise" her
brothers with a present of pipes for soap-bubbles,
and very likely if she began talking about the back
street at all it would make them think of Mrs.
Whelan's, and then they might think of the pipes
for themselves, which Peggy did not wish at all.
She felt quite big and managing since she had paid
a visit to the Smileys, and had a plan for going to
buy the pipes "all by my own self."</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Thorold, "there's to be a party
at our school. We're all three to go."</p>

<p>Peggy's face fell.</p>

<p>"It's Saturday," she said. "I thought you'd have
stayed with me."</p>

<p>Terence and Baldwin looked sorry.</p>

<p>"<i>I'll</i> stay at home," said Terry.</p>

<p>"No," said Thor, "I really don't think you can.
They're counting on you for some of the games. Peg
won't mind much for once, will you? I'm sorry
too."</p>

<p>But before Peggy had time to reply, Baldwin
broke in.</p>

<p>"I'll stay at home with Peg-top," he said, in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
slow, distinct way. "It won't matter for me not
going. I'm one of the little ones."</p>

<p>"And we'll go a nice walk, won't we, Baldwin?"
said Peggy, quite happy again. "And I daresay we
may have something nice for tea. I'll ask papa,"
she added to herself. "I'm sure he'll give me some
pennies when he hears how good Baldwin is."</p>

<p>Miss Earnshaw came the next morning, and in
the interest of being measured for her new spring
frock, and watching it being cut out, and considering
what she herself could make with the scraps which
the young dressmaker gave her, the time passed very
pleasantly for Peggy.</p>

<p>Miss Earnshaw admired the red shoes very much,
and was interested to hear the story of the unknown
lady who had given them to Peggy, and told a story
of a similar adventure of her own when she was a
little girl. And after dinner she, for Fanny was
very busy, took Peggy and Baldwin out for a walk,
and on their way home they went to the confectioner's
and bought six halfpenny buns with the
three pennies papa had given Peggy that morning.
At least the children thought there were only six,
but greatly to their surprise, when they undid the
parcel on the nursery table, out rolled seven!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said Peggy, "she's gave us one too
many. Must we go back to the shop with it, do you
think, Miss Earnshaw? It's such a long way."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Baldwin, beginning to fasten his
boots again.</p>

<p>But Miss Earnshaw assured them it was all right.</p>

<p>"You always get thirteen of any penny buns or
cakes for a shilling," she said; "and some shops will
give you seven halfpenny ones for threepence. That's
how it is. Did you never hear speak of a baker's
dozen?"</p>

<p>Still Peggy did not feel satisfied.</p>

<p>"It isn't comfable," she said, giving herself a little
wriggle&mdash;a trick of hers when she was put out.
"Six would have been much nicer&mdash;just two for
each," for Miss Earnshaw was to have tea with her
and Baldwin.</p>

<p>The young dressmaker smiled.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> funny, Miss Peggy," she said. "Well,
run off now and get ready for tea. We'll have Fanny
bringing it up in a minute."</p>

<p>Peggy, the seventh bun still much on her mind,
went slowly into the night nursery. Before beginning
to take off her hat she strolled to the window
and looked out. She had seen none of the children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to-day. Now, Brown Smiley was standing just in
front of the house, a basket on her arm, staring up
and down the street. She had been "of an errant"
for Mrs. Whelan, but Mrs. Whelan's door was locked;
she was either asleep or counting her money, and the
little girl knew that if she went on knocking the old
woman would get into a rage, so she was "waitin' a
bit." She liked better to do her waiting in the street,
for she had been busy indoors all the morning, and
it was a change to stand there looking about her.</p>

<p>Peggy gazed at her for a moment or two. Then
an idea struck her. She ran back into the nursery
and seized a bun&mdash;the odd bun.</p>

<p>"They're all mine, you know," she called out to
Baldwin; "but we'll have two each still."</p>

<p>Baldwin looked up in surprise. "What are you
going to do with it?" he began to say, but Peggy
was out of sight.</p>

<p>She was soon downstairs, and easily opened the
back door. But the yard door was fastened; she
found some difficulty in turning the big key. She
managed it at last, however, and saw to her delight
that Brown Smiley was still there.</p>

<p>"Brown," began Peggy, but suddenly recollecting
that the Smileys had real names, she stopped short,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and ran across the street. "I can't 'amember your
name," she exclaimed, breathlessly, "but I've brought
you this," and she held out the bun.</p>

<p>Brown Smiley's face smiled all over.</p>

<p>"Lor', miss," she exclaimed. "You are kind, to
be sure. Mayn't I give it to Lizzie? She's been
very bad to-day, and she's eat next to nought. This
'ere'll be tasty-like."</p>

<p>"Lizzie," repeated Peggy, "which is Lizzie? Oh
yes, I know, it's Crippley."</p>

<p>Brown Smiley looked rather hurt.</p>

<p>"It's not her fault, miss," she said. "I'd not like
her to hear herself called like that."</p>

<p>Peggy's face showed extreme surprise.</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" she said. "I've made
names for you all. I didn't know your real ones."</p>

<p>Brown Smiley looked at her and saw in a moment
that there was nothing to be vexed about.</p>

<p>"To be sure, miss. Beg your pardon. Well, she
that's lame's Lizzie, and me, I'm Matilda-Jane."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," interrupted Peggy. "Well, you may
give her the bun if you like. It's very kind of you,
for I meant it for you. I'd like&mdash;&mdash;" she went on,
"I'd like to give you more, but you see papa gaved
me the pennies for us, and p'raps he'd be vexed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure, that'd never do," replied
Matilda, quickly. "But oh, miss, we've been asking
father about Brackenshire, and the cottages. 'Tis
Brackenshire 'ills, sure enough, that's seen from your
front."</p>

<p>"I knew that," said Peggy, in a superior way.</p>

<p>But Brown Smiley was too eager to feel herself
snubbed.</p>

<p>"And oh, but he says it is bee-yutiful there&mdash;over
on the 'ills. The air's that fresh, and there's flowers
and big-leaved things as they calls ferns and brackens."</p>

<p>"And white cottages?" asked Peggy, anxiously.</p>

<p>"There's cottages&mdash;I didn't think for to ask if they
was all white. My! If we could but go there some
fine day. Father says it's not so far; many's the
time he's walked over there and back again the next
morning when he first comed to work here, you see,
miss, and his 'ome was still over there like."</p>

<p>"Yes, in the white cottage," said Peggy. She had
made up her mind that it was unkind not to "let it
be" that the Smileys' father had lived in that very
cottage, for he did seem to be a nice man in spite of
his bigness and his dingy workman's clothes. If he
wasn't nice and kind she didn't think the children
would talk of him as they did.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 459px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>But she spoke absently; Matilda-Jane's words had
put thoughts in her head which seemed to make her
almost giddy. Brown Smiley stared at her for a
minute.</p>

<p>"How she do cling to them cottages being white,"
she thought to herself, "but there&mdash;if it pleases her!
She's but a little one." "White if you please, miss,"
she replied, "though I can't say as I had it from
father."</p>

<p>But suddenly a window above opened, and Mother
Whelan's befrilled face was thrust out.</p>

<p>"What are ye about there then, and me fire burning
itself away, and me tea ready, waiting for the
bread? What's the young lady chatterin' to the
likes o' you for? Go home, missy, darlin', go home."</p>

<p>The two children jumped as if they had been
shot.</p>

<p>"Will she beat you?" whispered Peggy, looking
very frightened. But Brown Smiley shook her little
round head and laughed.</p>

<p>"She won't have a chance, and she dursn't not
to say beat us&mdash;father'd be down on her&mdash;but she
doesn't think nought of a good shakin'. But I'll
push the basket in and run off if she's in a real
wax."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-bye, then. You must tell me lots more
about the hills. Ask your father all you can," and
so saying, Peggy flew home again.</p>

<p>"Where've you been, what did you do with the
bun?" asked Baldwin, as soon as she came in to the
nursery.</p>

<p>"I runned down with it, and gaved it to a little
girl I saw in the street," said Peggy.</p>

<p>"Very kind and nice, I'm sure," said Miss Earnshaw.
"Was it a beggar, Miss Peggy? You're sure
your mamma and nurse wouldn't mind?" she added,
rather anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Peggy. "It's not a <i>beggar</i>. It's a
proper little poor girl what nurse gives our nold
clothes to."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Baldwin, "one of the children over
the cobbler's, I suppose. But, Peggy," he was going
on to say he didn't think his sister had ever been
allowed to run down to the back street to speak to
them, only he was so slow and so long of making up
his mind that, as Fanny just then came in with the
tea, which made a little bustle, nobody attended to
him, and Miss Earnshaw remained quite satisfied
that all was right.</p>

<p>The buns tasted very good&mdash;all the better to Peggy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
from the feeling that poor lame Lizzie was perhaps
eating hers at that same moment, and finding it
"tasty."</p>

<p>"Does lame people ever get quite better?" she
asked the young dressmaker.</p>

<p>"That depends," Miss Earnshaw replied. "If it's
through a fall or something that way, outside of them
so to say, there's many as gets better. But if it's <i>in</i>
them, in the constitution, there's many as stays lame
all their lives through."</p>

<p>Peggy wriggled a little. She didn't like to think
about it much. It sounded so mysterious.</p>

<p>"What part's that?" she asked; "that big word."</p>

<p>"Constitootion," said Baldwin, as if he was trying
to spell "Constantinople."</p>

<p>Miss Earnshaw laughed. She lived alone with
her mother, and was not much used to children.
But she was so pleasant-tempered and gentle that she
easily got into their ways.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't use such long words," she said.
"Our constitution just means ourselves&mdash;the way
we're made. A strong, healthy person is said to have
a good constitution, and a weakly person has a poor one."</p>

<p>Baldwin and Peggy both sat silent for a minute,
thinking over what she said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see how that's to do with crippling," said
Peggy at last. "Does you mean," she went on,
"that p'raps lame people's legs is made wrong&mdash;by
mistake, you know. <i>In course</i> God wouldn't do it of
purpose, would he?"</p>

<p>Baldwin looked rather startled.</p>

<p>"Peggy," he said, "I don't think you should speak
that way."</p>

<p>Peggy turned her gray eyes full upon him.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to say anything naughty," she said.
"<i>Is</i> it naughty, Miss Earnshaw?"</p>

<p>The young dressmaker had herself been rather
taken aback by Peggy's queer speech, and for a
moment or two scarcely knew what to say. But then
her face cleared again.</p>

<p>"God can't make mistakes, Miss Peggy," she said,
"and He is always kind. All the same there's many
things that seem like one or the other, I know. It must
be that there's reasons for them that we can't see&mdash;like
when a doctor hurts anybody, it seems unkind,
but it's <i>really</i> to do them good."</p>

<p>"Like when our doctor cutted poor Baby's tooths
to make them come through," said Peggy, eagerly.
"They was all <i>bleeding</i>, bleeding ever so, Miss Earnshaw.
Baby didn't understand, and he was <i>very</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
angry. He always sc'eams at the doctor now. I
almost think he'd like to kill him."</p>

<p>Baldwin opened his mouth wide at these bloodthirsty
sentiments of Baby's. He was too shocked
to speak.</p>

<p>"But it is only 'cos he doesn't understand," Peggy
went on, placidly. "<i>I</i> don't sc'eam at the doctor. I
speak to him quite goodly, 'cos, you see, <i>I</i> understand."</p>

<p>Baldwin closed his mouth again. He looked at
Peggy with admiring respect.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Miss Earnshaw, greatly relieved at
the turn their talk had taken, "that's just it, Miss
Peggy. You couldn't have put it better."</p>

<p>"Peggy," said Baldwin, "when you're big you
should be a clergymunt."</p>

"As I was going up Pippin Hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pippin Hill was dirty,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There I met a pretty miss,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And she dropped me a curtsey."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>Old Nursery Rhyme.</i></span><br />
<br /></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> particular happened during the next few
days. Peggy's little life went on regularly and
peacefully. Miss Earnshaw came every morning,
and either she or Fanny took Peggy a walk every
afternoon, except twice when it rained, to the little
girl's great disappointment.</div>

<p>The second of these wet days happened to be
Friday. Peggy stood at the front nursery window
that morning looking out rather sadly. There were
no hills&mdash;no white spot to be seen, of course.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the Smileys do when it rains all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
day," she said to herself. "I think I'll go to the
back window and look if I can see any of them."</p>

<p>She had scarcely caught sight of her neighbours
for some days. Only now and then she had seen
the little ones tumbling about on the pavement, and
once or twice the elder girls had brought their chairs
down and sat there sewing. Lizzie had never come
out. Peggy feared she must be still ill, and perhaps
that made the others extra busy. It was not likely
any of them would come out to-day, as it was raining
so; but <i>sometimes</i> she was able to see their faces
at the window. And on a rainy day some of the
little ones at least would perhaps be looking out.</p>

<p>She turned to go to the other nursery when Miss
Earnshaw spoke to her.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be so vexed at its being wet to-day,
Miss Peggy, if I was you," she said. "It'll be much
worse if it's wet to-morrow, for it's your brothers'
half-holiday."</p>

<p>"Is to-morrow Saturday?" asked Peggy.</p>

<p>"To be sure it is. And I'm afraid I can't possibly
stay here in the afternoon. I've got to go to see a
lady some way off about some work. I wish she
hadn't fixed for Saturday. If it's fine it won't matter
so much. Fanny and I were saying you could all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
go a nice walk&mdash;the young gentlemen and you, with
her. But if it's wet I don't know however she'll
manage you all in the house."</p>

<p>Suddenly Peggy's eyes began to sparkle.</p>

<p>"Miss Earnshaw," she said, "I've thought of
something. If you'll ask Fanny, I'm sure she'll say
we can; we've not had them for such a long time,
and I've got my four pennies and a halfpenny&mdash;that'll
get six, you know, in case any's brokened."</p>

<p>Miss Earnshaw looked at her and then began to
laugh.</p>

<p>"Miss Peggy dear, you must tell me first what
you mean," she said. "Your thoughts come so fast
that they run ahead of your words. What is it you
mean to get six of&mdash;not buns?"</p>

<p>"Buns!" repeated Peggy. "You can't blow
bubbles with buns. No, of course I meant pipes.
Nice white pipes to blow soap-bubbles."</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure," said Miss Earnshaw. "That's
a very good idea, Miss Peggy, in case to-morrow
afternoon's wet, and I shouldn't wonder if it was."</p>

<p>"And you'll ask Fanny?"</p>

<p>"Of course; you can ask her yourself for that
matter. I'm sure she's the last to grudge you anything
that'd please you and the young gentlemen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
And even if soap-bubbles are rather messy sometimes,
it's easy to wipe up. It's not like anything
dirty."</p>

<p>"Soap must be clean, mustn't it?" said Peggy,
laughing. "But don't tell the boys, pelease, dear
Miss Earnshaw. I do so want to 'apprise them. I
can get the pipes to-morrow morning. I know where
to get them," and quite happy, Peggy trotted off to
take out her money-box and look to be quite sure
that the three pennies and three halfpennies were
there in safety, where for some weeks they had been
waiting.</p>

<p>"Bless her heart," said the young dressmaker.
"She is the sweetest little innocent darling that ever
lived."</p>

<p>After looking over her pennies Peggy turned to
the window. No, none of the Smileys were to be
seen.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Peggy to herself. "I'll
p'raps see them to-morrow when I go for the pipes.
I almost hope it'll be a wet day. It will be so nice
to blow soap-bubbles. Only," and she sighed a little,
"it does seem such a very long time since I sawed
the white cottage."</p>

<p>To-morrow <i>was</i> rainy, very rainy, with no look of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
"going to clear up" about it. The boys grumbled a
good deal at breakfast at the doleful prospect of a
dull half-holiday in the house.</p>

<p>"And papa's going away to-day till Monday,"
said Thorold; "so there'll be no going down to the
dining-room to sit beside him while he's at dinner
for a change."</p>

<p>"Poor papa," said Peggy, "he'll get very wet
going such a long way."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, you little goose," said Thor, crossly.
"People don't get wet in cabs and railway carriages."</p>

<p>"I forgot," said Peggy, meekly.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't call her a goose, Thor," said
Terence. "It's very disagreeable to travel on a very
rainy day. I've often heard people say so."</p>

<p>"I wish I was going to travel, rainy or not, I
know that," grumbled Thorold. "Here we shall be
mewed up in this stupid nursery all the afternoon
with nothing to do."</p>

<p>"There's lots of things to do," said Baldwin. "I
think I'll write a letter to mamma for one thing.
And I want to tidy my treasure-box and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're a stupid," said Thorold. "You're too fat
and slow to have any spirit in you."</p>

<p>"Now, Thorold, I say that's not fair," said Terry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would it show spirit to grumble? You'd be down
upon him if he did. There's no pleasing you."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> know something that would please him," said
Peggy, who was trembling between eagerness to tell
and determination <i>not</i> to tell her "surprise."</p>

<p>"What?" said Thor, rather grumpily still.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to tell you till you come home.
And it'll only be if it's a rainy afternoon," said Peggy.</p>

<p>Terence and Baldwin pricked up their ears.</p>

<p>"Oh, do tell us, Peg-top," they said.</p>

<p>But the little girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, no," she replied. "I've promised myself&mdash;<i>quite</i>
promised not."</p>

<p>"There's a reason for you," said Thor. But his
tone was more good-natured now. He felt ashamed
of being so cross when the little ones were so kind
and bright.</p>

<p>"I'll really, <i>truly</i> tell you when you come back
from school," said Peggy, and with this assurance
the boys had to content themselves.</p>

<p>Miss Earnshaw arrived as usual, or rather not as
usual, for she was dripping, poor thing, and had to
leave her waterproof downstairs in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"What weather, Miss Peggy," she said, as she
came in. "I thought it would be a wet day, but not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
such a pour. It is unfortunate that I have to go so
far to-day, isn't it? And I'm sorry to leave you
children alone too."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Peggy, cheerily; "we'll be
quite happy with the soap bubbles. I've got my
money quite ready. Mayn't I go and get the pipes
now?"</p>

<p>"Out, my dear? In such weather!" exclaimed
Miss Earnshaw.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's <i>quite</i> near," said Peggy. "Just hop
out of the door and you're there. The boys always
buy their pipes there, and mamma goes there herself
sometimes to see the old woman."</p>

<p>"Well, wait a bit, any way. It can't go on raining
as fast as this all the morning surely. It's real
cats and dogs."</p>

<p>Peggy looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"Cats and dogs, Miss Earnshaw?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Oh, bless you, my dear, it's only a way of speaking,"
said the dressmaker, a little impatiently, for
she was not very much accustomed to children.
"It just means raining <i>very</i> hard."</p>

<p>Peggy went to the window to look out for herself.
Yes indeed it was raining very hard. The little
girl could not help sighing a little as she gazed at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the thick even gray of the clouds, hiding like a
curtain every trace of the distant hills she was so
fond of.</p>

<p>"I won't put out the little red shoes to-day," she
said to herself, "there's nothing for them to see."</p>

<p>Then other thoughts crept into her mind.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it's raining at the white cottage
too," she said to herself. And aloud she asked a
question.</p>

<p>"Miss Earnshaw, pelease, does it ever rain in the
country?" she said.</p>

<p>"Rain in the country! I should rather think it did.
Worse than in town, you might say&mdash;that's to say,
where there's less shelter, you'll get wetter and dirtier
in the country, only of course it's not the same kind
of really black sooty rain. But as for mud in country
lanes! I shall see something of it this afternoon, I
expect."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry," said Peggy. "I thought it
never rained in the country. I thought it was
always quite pretty and lovely," and she sighed
deeply. "I wonder what people who live in little
cottages in the country do all day when it rains," she
said.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, much the same as other folk, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
should say. They have their rooms to clean, and
their dinner to cook, and their children to look after.
Still I daresay it'd be a bit drearier in the country
of a right-down wet day like this, even than in town.
I've never lived there myself, except for a week at a
time at most, but mother was all her young days in
the country."</p>

<p>"Everybody's fathers and mothers lived there,"
said Peggy, rather petulantly. "Why don't peoples let
their children live there now?"</p>

<p>Miss Earnshaw laughed a little. Peggy did not
like her to laugh in that way, and she gave herself a
little wriggle, though poor Miss Earnshaw certainly
did not mean to vex her.</p>

<p>"There are plenty of children in the country too,
Miss Peggy," she said. "Mother's youngest sister
has twelve."</p>

<p>"Twelve," repeated Peggy, "<i>how</i> nice! at least if
there's lots of sisters among them, and no very little
babies. Do they live over in that country?" she
went on, pointing in the direction of the invisible
hills, "that country called Brack&mdash;&mdash; You know the
name."</p>

<p>"Brackenshire," said Miss Earnshaw, "no, my
mother comes from much farther off. A very pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
place it must be by what she says. Not but what
Brackenshire's a pretty country too. I've been there
several times with the Sunday school for a treat."</p>

<p>"And did you see the hills and the white cottages?"
asked Peggy breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, the hills are beautiful, and there's lots of
cottages of all kinds. They look pretty among the
trees, even though they're only poor little places, most
of them."</p>

<p>"The white ones is the prettiest," said Peggy, as
if she knew all about it.</p>

<p>"Yes, I daresay," said Miss Earnshaw, without
paying much attention; she had got to rather a difficult
part of the sleeve she was making.</p>

<p>"Did you ever walk all the way there when you
was a little girl?" Peggy went on.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course," Miss Earnshaw replied, without
the least idea of what she was answering.</p>

<p>"Really!" said Peggy, "how nice!" Then seeing
that the dressmaker was absorbed in her work: "Miss
Earnshaw," she said, "I'm going for the pipes now.
It isn't raining <i>quite</i> so fast, and I'll not be long."</p>

<p>"Very well, my dear," Miss Earnshaw replied,
and Peggy went off to fetch her pennies from the
drawer in the other nursery where she kept them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
She had a new idea in her head, an idea which Miss
Earnshaw's careless words had helped to put there,
little as she knew it.</p>

<p>"If I see the Smileys," thought Peggy, "I'll tell
them what she said."</p>

<p>She glanced out of the window, dear me, how
lucky! There stood Brown Smiley looking out at
the door, as if she were hesitating before making a
plunge into the dripping wet street. It did seem at
the back as if it were raining faster than in front.
Peggy opened the cupboard and took out her little
cloak which was hanging there.</p>

<p>"I won't put on my hat," she thought, "'cos nurse
says the rain spoils the feavers. I'll get a numbrella
downstairs, and then I <i>can't</i> get wet, and here's my
pennies all right in my pocket. I do hope Brown
Smiley will wait till I get down."</p>

<p>She made all the haste she could, and found, as
she expected, an umbrella in the stand downstairs.
It was not very easy to open, but she succeeded at
last, then came, however, another difficulty, she could
not get herself and the umbrella through the back
door together.</p>

<p>"Dear me," thought Peggy, "I wonder how people
does with their numbrellas. They <i>must</i> open them in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the house, else they'd get wet standing outside while
they're doing it. I never looked to see how nurse
does, but then we almost never go out when it's
rainy. I 'appose it's one of the hard things big
peoples has to learn. Oh, dear! <i>won't</i> it come through?"</p>

<p>No, she couldn't manage it, at least not with
herself under it. At last a brilliant idea struck
Peggy; anything was better than closing the tiresome
thing now she <i>had</i> got it opened&mdash;she would
send it first and follow after herself. So the umbrella
was passed through, and went slipping down the two
or three steps that led into the yard, where it lay
gaping up reproachfully at Peggy, who felt inclined
to call out "Never mind, poor thing, I'm coming
d'reckly."</p>

<p>And as "d'reckly" as possible she did come, carefully
closing the door behind her, for fear the rain
should get into the house, which, together with the
picking up of the umbrella, far too big and heavy a
one for a tiny girl, took so long that I am afraid a
good many drops had time to fall on the fair uncovered
head before it got under shelter again.</p>

<p>But little cared Peggy. She felt as proud as a
peacock, the umbrella representing the tail, you understand,
when she found herself outside the yard door,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
which behaved very amiably, fairly under weigh for
her voyage across the street. She could see nothing
before her; fortunately, however, no carriages or carts
ever came down the narrow back way.</p>

<p>Half-way over Peggy stopped short&mdash;she had forgotten
to look if Brown Smiley was still standing
there. It was not easy to get a peep from under the
umbrella, without tilting it and herself backwards on
to the muddy road, but with great care Peggy
managed it. Ah dear, what a disappointment! There
was no little girl in front of the cobbler's window,
but glancing to one side, Peggy caught sight of the
small figure with a shawl of "mother's" quaintly
drawn over the head, trotting away down the street.
With a cry Peggy dashed after her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Brown Smiley," she called out, "do come
back. I'm too frightened to go to buy the pipes
alone," for what with her struggles and her excitement,
the little damsel's nerves were rather upset.
"Oh, Brown Smiley&mdash;no&mdash;no, that's not her name,
oh what <i>is</i> your name, Brown Smiley?" and on along
the rough pavement behind the little messenger she
rushed, if indeed poor Peggy's toddling, flopping from
one side to another progress, could possibly be called
"rushing."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="459" height="700" alt="&quot;But an umbrella rolling itself about on the pavement...." title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>It came to an end quickly&mdash;the paving-stones
were rough and uneven, the small feet had only "my
noldest house-shoes" to protect them, and the "numbrella"
was sadly in the way; there came suddenly a
sharp cry, so piercing and distressful that even Matilda-Jane,
accustomed as she was to childish sounds of
woe of every kind and pitch, was startled enough to
turn round and look behind her.</p>

<p>"Can it be Halfred come a-runnin' after me?"
she said to herself. But the sight that met her eyes
puzzled her so, that at the risk of Mother Whelan's
scoldings for being so long, she could not resist
running back to examine for herself the strange
object. This was nothing more nor less than an
umbrella, and an umbrella in itself is not an uncommon
sight. But an umbrella rolling itself about
on the pavement, an umbrella from which proceeds
most piteous wails, an umbrella from underneath
which, when you get close to it, you see two little
feet sticking out and by degrees two neat black legs,
and then a muddle of short skirts, which by rights
should be draping the legs, but have somehow got
all turned upside down like a bird's feathers ruffled
up the wrong way&mdash;<i>such</i> an umbrella, or perhaps
I should say an umbrella in such circumstances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
certainly may be called a strange sight, may it
not?</p>

<p>Matilda-Jane Simpkins, for that was Brown
Smiley's whole long name, thought so any way, for
she stood stock still, staring, and the only thing she
could collect herself enough to say was, "Lor'!"</p>

<p>But her state of stupefaction only lasted half a
moment. She was a practical and business-like
little person; before there was time for another cry
for help, she had disentangled the umbrella and its
owner, and set the latter on her feet again, sobbing
piteously, and dreadfully dirty and muddy, but
otherwise not much the worse.</p>

<p>Then Matilda-Jane gave vent to another exclamation.</p>

<p>"Bless me, missy, it's <i>you!</i>" she cried. "Whatever
are you a-doing of to be out in the rain all
alone, with no 'at and a humbrella four sizes too big
for the likes of you, and them paper-soled things on
yer feet? and, oh my! ain't yer frock muddy?
What'll your folk say to you? Or is they all away
and left you and the cat to keep 'ouse?"</p>

<p>"I was running after you, Brown Smiley,"
sobbed Peggy. She could not quite make out if
Matilda-Jane was making fun of her or not, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
indeed, to do Matilda justice, she had no such intention.
"I was running after <i>you</i>," Peggy repeated,
"and you <i>wouldn't</i> stop, and I couldn't run fast 'cos
of the numbrella, and so I felled down."</p>

<p>"Never mind, missy dear, you'll be none the
worse, you'll see. Only, will they give it you when
you go home for dirtying of your frock?"</p>

<p>"Give it me?" repeated Peggy.</p>

<p>"Yes, give it you; will you get it&mdash;will you
catch it?" said Matilda, impatiently.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," Peggy replied.</p>

<p>Matilda wasted no more words on her. She took
her by the arm, umbrella and all, and trotted her
down the street again till they had reached the
Smiley mansion. Then she drew Peggy inside the
doorway of the passage, whence a stair led up to
Mrs. Whelan's, and to the Simpkins's own rooms
above that again, and having shut up the umbrella
with such perfect ease that Peggy gazed at her in
admiration, she tried to explain her meaning.</p>

<p>"Look 'ere now, miss;" she said, "which'll you
do&mdash;go straight over-the-way 'ome, just as you are,
or come in along of <i>huz</i> and get yerself cleaned up
a bit?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll go in with you, pelease," sobbed Peggy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"P'raps Miss Earnshaw wouldn't scold me. She let
me come, and I didn't fell down on purpose. But I
<i>know</i> she wouldn't let me come out again&mdash;I'm sure
she wouldn't, and I do so want to get the pipes my
own self. You'll take me to Mrs. Whelan's, won't
you, dear Brown Smiley?"</p>

<p>"I'll catch it when she sees I haven't done her
errant," said Matilda. "But never mind; she'll not
be so bad with you there, maybe. Come up with
me, missy, and I'll get Rebecca to wipe you a bit,"
and she began the ascent of the narrow staircase,
followed by Peggy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE OPPOSITE HOUSE<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
"There was an old woman that lived in a shoe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She had so many children she didn't know what to do."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;"><i>Nursery Rhymes.</i></span><br />
<br /></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of her misfortunes, Peggy could not help
feeling very pleased at finding herself at last inside
the house she had watched so often from the outside.
It was certainly not a pretty house&mdash;a big person
would probably have thought it a very poor and
uninteresting one; but it was not dirty. The old
wooden steps were scrubbed down once a week
regularly, so there was nothing to strike the little
girl as disagreeable, and it seemed delightfully queer
and mysterious as she climbed the steep, uneven
staircase, which grew darker and darker as they went
on, so that but for Brown Smiley's voice in front,
Peggy would not have had the least idea where she
was going.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's Mother Whelan's door," Matilda said in
a half whisper, as if afraid of the old woman's
pouncing out upon them, and Peggy wondered how
she knew it, for to her everything was perfectly
dark; "but we'll go upstairs first to Rebecca," and
on they climbed.</p>

<p>Suddenly, what seemed for a moment a blaze of
brilliant light from the contrast with the darkness
where they were, broke upon them. Peggy quite
started. But it was only the opening of a door.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Matilda-Jane? My, but you have
been sharp. I should think old Whelan 'ud be
pleased for onst."</p>

<p>The speaker was Reddy; she stood in the doorway,
her bare red arms shining, as they always did,
from being so often up to the elbows in soap and
water.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rebecca, don't say nothin', but I've not
been of my errant yet. Now, don't ye begin at me&mdash;'tweren't
of my fault. I was a-'urryin' along
when I saw miss 'ere a-rollin' in the wet with her
humberellar, and I 'ad to pick her up. She's that
muddy we were afeard they'd give it her over the
way&mdash;her mar's away. So I told her as you'd tidy
her up a bit. Come along, missy. Rebecca's got a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
good 'eart, has Rebecca; she'll clean you nicely,
you'll see."</p>

<p>For at the sound of Rebecca's sharp voice poor
Peggy had slunk back into the friendly gloom of the
staircase. But she came creeping forward now, so
that Reddy saw her.</p>

<p>"Lor'!" said the big girl, "little miss from the
hopposite winder to be sure."</p>

<p>This quite restored Peggy's courage.</p>

<p>"Have you seen me at the window?" she said.
"How funny! I've looked at you lotses and lotses
of times, but I never thought of you looking at me."</p>

<p>To which both sisters replied with their favourite
exclamation, "Lor'!"</p>

<p>Just then came a voice from inside.</p>

<p>"Shut the door there, Rebecca, can't you? If
there's one thing I can't abide, and you might know it,
it's a hopen door, and the draught right on baby's head."</p>

<p>Rebecca took Peggy by the hand and drew her
into the room, and while she was relating the story
of little missy's misfortunes to her mother, little
missy looked round her with the greatest interest.</p>

<p>It was a small room, but oh, how full of children!
Dinner was being got ready "against father and the
boys coming home," Matilda said, but where father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and the boys could possibly find space to stand, much
less to sit, Peggy lay awake wondering for a long
time that night. She counted over all those already
present, and found they were all there except Lizzie,
the lame girl. And besides the two babies and Alfred,
whom she knew by sight, she was amazed to see a
fourth, a very tiny doll of a thing&mdash;the tiniest thing
she had ever seen, but which they all were as proud
of as if there had never been a baby among them
before. At this moment it was reposing in the arms
of Mary-Hann; Light Smiley, whose real name was
Sarah, you remember, was taking charge of the two
big babies in one corner, while Reddy and her
mother were busy at the fire, and "Halfred" was
amusing himself quietly with some marbles, apparently
his natural occupation.</p>

<p>What a lot of them! Peggy began to feel less
sure that she would like to have as many sisters as
the Smileys. Still they all looked happy, and their
mother, whom Peggy had never seen before, had
really a very kind face.</p>

<p>"I'll see to the pot, Rebecca," she said; "just
you wipe missy's frock a bit. 'Twill be none the
worse, you'll see. And so your dear mar's away
missy. I 'ope the change'll do her good."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, thank you," said Peggy. "She's gone to
the country. Did you ever live in the country?
And was it in a white cottage?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Simpkins smiled.</p>

<p>"No, missy, I'm town-bred. 'Tis father as knows
all about the country; he's a Brackenshire man."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Peggy, "I forgot. It's Miss Earnshaw's
mother I was thinking of."</p>

<p>"But father," said Matilda, "<i>he</i> can tell lots of
tales about the country."</p>

<p>"I wish he was at home," said Peggy. "But I
must go, now my frock's cleaned. Some day p'raps
I'll come again. Thank you, Reddy," at which
Rebecca, who had been vigorously rubbing Peggy's
skirts, stared and looked as if she were going to say
"Lor'!" "I'm going to buy soap-bubble pipes at
Mrs. Whelan's," Peggy went on, for she was losing
her shyness now; "that's what I comed out in the
rain for. We're going to play at soap-bubbles this
afternoon, 'cos it's too wet to go out a walk."</p>

<p>All the Smileys listened with great interest.</p>

<p>"Mayn't Brown&mdash;I mean Matilda-Jane&mdash;come
with me, pelease?" said Peggy. "I'm <i>razer</i> frightened
to go to buy them alone; sometimes that old
woman does look so cross."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"She looks what she is then," said Reddy, "'cept
for one thing; she's awful good to Lizzie. She's
a-sittin' down there this very minute as is, is Lizzie,
to be out o' the way like when mother and me's
cleaning, you see, miss."</p>

<p>Brown Smiley's face had grown grave.</p>

<p>"I dursn't let Mother Whelan see as I've not
gone," she said, "but if missy doesn't like to go
alone&mdash;not as she'd be sharp to the likes of you, but
still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>I'll</i> go," said little Sarah, Light Smiley, that is
to say. "Jest you see to the childer will ye, Mary-Hann?"
she shouted to the deaf sister. "I won't
be harf a minute."</p>

<p>"And you, Matilda-Jane, off with you," said
Rebecca, which advice Brown Smiley instantly
followed.</p>

<p>Sarah took Peggy's hand to escort her down the
dark staircase again. Light Smiley was, of all the
family perhaps, Peggy's favourite. She was two
years or so older than her little opposite neighbour,
but she scarcely looked it, for both she and Brown
Smiley were small and slight, and when you came
to speak to them both, Sarah seemed a good deal
younger than Matilda; she was so much less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
managing and decided in manner, but on the present
occasion Peggy would have preferred the elder
Smiley, for to tell the truth her heart was beginning
to beat much faster than usual at the thought of
facing Mrs. Whelan in her den.</p>

<p>"Isn't you frightened, Light Smiley?" asked the
little girl when the two stopped, and Peggy knew
by this that they must be at the old woman's
door.</p>

<p>"Oh no," Sarah replied. "Tisn't as if we'd been
up to any mischief, you see. And Lizzie's there.
She's mostly quiet when Lizzie's there."</p>

<p>So saying she pushed the door open. It had a
bell inside, which forthwith began to tinkle loudly,
and made Peggy start. This bell was the pride of
Mrs. Whelan's heart; it made such a distinction, she
thought, between her and the rest of the tenants of
the house, and the more noisily it rang the better
pleased she was. Sarah knew this, and gave the
door a good shove, at the same time pulling Peggy
into the room.</p>

<p>"What's it yer afther now, and what's become of
Matilda-Jane?" called out the old woman, not, at
the first moment, catching sight of Peggy.</p>

<p>"It's little missy from over-the-way," Sarah<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
hastened to explain; "she's come to buy some pipes
of you, Mother Whelan."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 466px;">
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="466" height="700" alt="&quot;To be sure,&quot; she said in her most gracious tone...." title="" />
</div>

<p>Mrs. Whelan looked at Peggy where she stood
behind Sarah, gravely staring about her.</p>

<p>"To be sure," she said in her most gracious tone.
"'Tis the beautiful pipes I have. And 'tis proud
I am to say the purty young lady," and on she went
with a long flattering speech about Peggy's likeness
to her "swate mother," and inquiries after the lady's
health, all the time she was reaching down from a
high shelf an old broken cardboard box, containing
her stock of clay pipes.</p>

<p>Peggy did not answer. In the first place, thanks
to the old woman's Irish accent and queer way of
speaking she did not understand a quarter of what
she said. Then her eyes were busy gazing all about,
and her nose was even less pleasantly occupied, for
there was a very strong smell in the room. It was
a sort of mixed smell of everything&mdash;not like the
curious "everything" smell that one knows so well
in a village shop in the country, which for my part
I think rather nice&mdash;a smell of tea, and coffee, and
bacon, and nuts, and soap, and matting, and brown
holland, and spices, and dried herbs, all mixed together,
but with a clean feeling about it&mdash;no, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
smell in Mrs. Whelan's was much stuffier and snuffier.
For joined to the odour of all the things I have
named was that of herrings and tobacco smoke, and,
I rather fear, of whisky. And besides all this, I
am very much afraid that not only a spring cleaning
but a summer or autumn or winter cleaning, were
unknown events in the old woman's room. No
wonder that Peggy, fresh from the soft-soap-and-water
smell of the Simpkins's upstairs, sniffed uneasily
and wished Mrs. Whelan would be quick with
the pipes; her head felt so queer and confused.</p>

<p>But looking round she caught sight of a very
interesting object; this was Lizzie, rocking herself
gently on her chair in a corner, and seeming quite at
home. Peggy ran&mdash;no she couldn't run&mdash;the room
was so crowded, for a counter stood across one end,
and in the other a big square old bedstead, and
between the two were a table and one or two chairs,
and an old tumble-down chest of drawers&mdash;made her
way over to Lizzie.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Crip&mdash;Lizzie, I mean? I hope
your pains aren't very bad to-day?"</p>

<p>"Not so very, thank you, miss," said the poor
girl. "It's nice and quiet in here, and the quiet
does me a deal o' good."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Peggy sighed.</p>

<p>"I don't like being very quiet," she said. "I
wish you could come over to the nursery; now that
Hal and baby and nurse are away it's dreffully
quiet."</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't care to change places with me,
would you, missy?" said Lizzie. "I'm thinking
you'd have noise enough if you were upstairs sometimes.
My&mdash;it do go through one's head, to be sure."</p>

<p>Peggy looked very sympathising.</p>

<p>"Aren't you frightened of <i>her?</i>" she whispered,
nodding gently towards Mrs. Whelan.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Lizzie, also lowering her
voice; "she's right down good to me, is the old body.
She do scold now and then and no mistake, but bless
you, she'd never lay a finger on me, and it's no
wonder she's in a taking with the children when
they kicks up a hextra row, so to say."</p>

<p>Peggy's mouth had opened gradually during this
speech, and now it remained so. She could not
understand half Lizzie's words, but she had no
time to ask for an explanation, for just then Light
Smiley called to her to come and look at the pipes
which were by this time waiting for her on the
counter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>They were the cleanest things in the room&mdash;the
only clean things it seemed to Peggy as she lifted
them up one by one to choose six very nice ones.
And then she paid her pennies and ran back to
shake hands with Lizzie and say good-bye to her&mdash;she
wondered if she should shake hands with Mrs.
Whelan too, but fortunately the old woman did not
seem to expect it, and Peggy felt very thankful, for
her brown wrinkled hands looked sadly dirty to the
little girl, dirtier perhaps than they really were.</p>

<p>"I like your house much better than hers," said
Peggy, when she and Light Smiley were down at
the bottom of the stairs again; "it smells much
nicer."</p>

<p>"Mother and Rebecca's all for scrubbing, that's
certing," replied Sarah, with a smile of pleasure&mdash;of
course all little girls like to hear their homes praised&mdash;"but
she's not bad to Lizzie, is old Whelan," as if
that settled the whole question, and Peggy felt she
must not say any more about the dirty room.</p>

<p>Light Smiley felt it her duty to see "missy" safe
across the street. Peggy's hands were laden with the
precious pipes, and Sarah carried the big umbrella
over the two of them. They chattered as they
picked their way through the mud and stood for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
minute or two at the yard-door of Peggy's house.
Light Smiley peeped in.</p>

<p>"Lor'," she said, expressing her feelings in the
same way as her sisters, "yours must be a fine
house, missy. All that there back-yard for yerselves."</p>

<p>"You should see the droind-room, and mamma's
room; there's a marble top to the washing-stand,"
said Peggy, with pride.</p>

<p>"Lor'," said Sarah again.</p>

<p>"Some day," Peggy went on, excited by Sarah's
admiration, "<i>some</i> day when my mamma comes
home, I'm going to ask her to let me have a tea-party
of you <i>all</i>&mdash;in the nursery, you know. The
nursery's nice too, at least I daresay you'd like it."</p>

<p>"Is that the winder where you sees us from?"
asked Sarah. "Matilda-Jane says as how we could
see you too quite plain at it if you put your face
quite close to the glass."</p>

<p>"I can't," said Peggy. "There's the toilet-table
close to the window&mdash;at least, it's really a chest of
drawers, you know, but there's a looking-glass on the
top and a white cover, so it's like a toilet-table for
nurse, though it's too high up for me. I have to
stand on a chair if I want to see myself popperly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear!" said Sarah sympathisingly.</p>

<p>"And I can only see you by scrooging into the
corner, and the curting's there. No, you couldn't ever
see me well up at the window. But that's not the
nursery where we'd have tea. That's only the night
nursery. The other one's to the front; that's the
window where you can see the hills far away."</p>

<p>"In the country, where father used to live. Oh
yes, I know. I heerd Matilda-Jane a-asking 'im
about it," said Sarah.</p>

<p>"Oh, and did he tell you any more? Do ask
him if it's really not far to get there," said Peggy,
eagerly.</p>

<p>Sarah nodded.</p>

<p>"I won't forget," she said; "and then, missy,
when you axes us to the tea-party, I'll be able to
tell you all about it."</p>

<p>She did not mean to be cunning, poor little girl,
but she was rather afraid Peggy might forget about
the tea-party, and she thought it was not a bad plan
to say something which might help to make her
remember it.</p>

<p>"Yes," Peggy replied, "that would be lovely.
Do make him tell all you can, Light Smiley. Oh,
I do wish mamma would come home now, and I'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
ask her about the tea-party immediately. I'm sure
she'd let me, for she likes us to be kind to poor
people."</p>

<p>Sarah drew herself up a little at this.</p>

<p>"We're not&mdash;not to say <i>poor</i> folk," she said, with
some dignity. "There's a many of us, and it's hard
enough work, but still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be vexed," said Peggy. "I know
you're not like&mdash;like beggars, you know. And I
think <i>we're</i> rather poor too. Mamma often says papa
has to work hard."</p>

<p>Sarah grew quite friendly again.</p>

<p>"I take it folks isn't often rich when they've a
lot of children," she began, but the sound of a window
opening across the street made her start. "Bless
me," she said, "I must run. There's Rebecca a-going
to scold me for standing talking. Good-bye, miss,
I'll not forget to ask father."</p>

<p>And Sarah darted away, carrying with her the
umbrella, quite forgetting that it was Peggy's. Peggy
forgot it too, and it was not raining so fast now,
so there was less to remind her. She shut the
door and ran across the yard. The house door still
stood open, and she made her way up to the nursery
without meeting any one.</p>

<br /></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">There</span> was no one upstairs. Miss Earnshaw had
gone down to the kitchen to iron the seams of her
work, without giving special thought to Peggy. If
any one had asked her where the child was she
would have probably answered that she was counting
over her money in the night nursery. So she
was rather surprised when coming upstairs again in
a few minutes she was met by Peggy flying to meet
her with the pipes in her hand.</div>

<p>"I've got them, Miss Earnshaw; aren't they
beauties?" she cried. "And I don't think my frock's
reely spoilt? It only just looks a <i>little</i> funny where
the mud was."</p>

<p>"Bless me!" exclaimed the young dressmaker,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
"wherever have you been, Miss Peggy? No, your
frock'll brush all right; but you don't mean to say
you've been out in the rain? You should have asked
me, my dear."</p>

<p>She spoke rather reproachfully; she was a little
vexed with herself for not having looked after the
child better, but Peggy was one of those quiet "old-fashioned"
children, who never seem to need looking
after.</p>

<p>"I did ask you," said Peggy, opening wide her
eyes, "and you said, 'Very well, my dear.'"</p>

<p>Miss Earnshaw couldn't help smiling.</p>

<p>"I must have been thinking more of your new
frock than of yourself," she said. "However, I hope
it's done you no harm. Your stockings aren't
wet?"</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Peggy; "my slippers were a weeny
bit wet, so I've changed them. My frock wouldn't
have been dirtied, only I felled in the wet, Miss
Earnshaw, but Brown&mdash;one of the little girls, you
know, that lives in the house where the shop is&mdash;picked
me up, and there's no harm done, is there?
And I've got the pipes, and won't my brothers be
peleased," she chirruped on in her soft, cheery way.</p>

<p>Miss Earnshaw could not blame her, though she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
determined to be more on the look-out for the future.
And soon after came twelve o'clock, and then the
young dressmaker was obliged to go, bidding Peggy
"Good-bye till Monday morning."</p>

<p>The boys came home wet and hungry, and grumbling
a good deal at the rainy half-holiday. Peggy
had hidden the six pipes in her little bed, but after
dinner she made the three boys shut their eyes
while she fetched them out and laid them in a row
on the table. Then, "You may look now," she said;
"it's my apprise," and she stood at one side to enjoy
the sight of their pleasure.</p>

<p>"Hurrah," cried Terry, "pipes for soap-bubbles!
Isn't it jolly? Isn't Peggy a brick?"</p>

<p>"Dear Peggy," said Baldwin, holding up his
plump face for a kiss.</p>

<p>"Poor old Peg-top," said Thor, patronisingly.
"They seem very good pipes; and as there's six of
them, you and I can break one a-piece if we like,
Terry, without its mattering."</p>

<p>Peggy looked rather anxious at this.</p>

<p>"Don't try to break them, Thor, pelease," she
said; "for if you beginned breaking it might go on,
and then it would be all spoilt like the last time, for
there's no fun in soap-bubbling by turns."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, that's quite true," said Terry. "You remember
the last time how stupid it was. But of
course we won't break any, 'specially as they're
yours, Peggy. We'll try and keep them good for
another time."</p>

<p>"Did you spend all your pennies for them?"
asked Baldwin, sympathisingly.</p>

<p>"Not quite all," said Peggy. "I choosed them
myself," she went on, importantly. "There was a
lot in a box."</p>

<p>"Why, where did you get them? You didn't go
yourself to old Whelan's, surely?" asked Thor,
sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, I runned across the road," said Peggy.
"You always get them there, Thor."</p>

<p>"But it's quite different. I can tell you mamma
won't be very pleased when she comes home to hear
you've been so disobedient."</p>

<p>Poor Peggy's face, so bright and happy, clouded
over, and she seemed on the point of bursting into
tears.</p>

<p>"I weren't disobedient," she began. "Miss Earnshaw
said, 'Very well, dear,' and so I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="459" height="700" alt="&quot;They were soon all four very happy at the pretty play....&quot;" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Of course," interrupted Terry; "Peggy's never
disobedient, Thor. We'll ask mamma when she comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
home; but she won't be vexed with you, darling.
You won't need to go again before then."</p>

<p>"No," said Peggy, comforted, "I don't want to go
again, Terry dear. It doesn't smell very nice in the
shop. But the <i>children's</i> house is very clean, Terry.
I'm sure mamma would let us go <i>there</i>."</p>

<p>"Those Simpkinses over old Whelan's," said
Terry. "Oh yes, I know mother goes there herself
sometimes, though as for that she goes to old Whelan's
too. But we're wasting time; let's ask Fanny for a
tin basin and lots of soap."</p>

<p>They were soon all four very happy at the pretty
play. The prettiness of it was what Peggy enjoyed
the most; the boys, boy-like, thought little but of
who could blow the biggest bubbles, which, as
everybody knows, are seldom as rich in colour as
smaller ones.</p>

<p>"I like the rainbowiest ones best," said Peggy.
"I don't care for those 'normous ones Thor makes.
Do you, Baldwin?"</p>

<p>Baldwin stopped to consider.</p>

<p>"I suppose very big things aren't never so pretty
as littler things," he said at last, when a sort of grunt
from Terry interrupted him. Terry could not speak,
his cheeks were all puffed out round the pipe, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
dared not stop blowing. He could only grunt and
nod his head sharply to catch their attention to the
wonderful triumph in soap-bubbles floating before
his nose. There was a big one, as big as any of
Thorold's, and up on the top of it a lovely every-coloured
wee one, the most brilliant the children had
ever seen&mdash;a real rainbow ball.</p>

<p>They all clapped their hands, at least Peggy and
Baldwin did so. Thorold shouted, "Hurrah for Terry's
new invention. It's like a monkey riding on an
elephant." But Peggy did not think that was a
pretty idea.</p>

<p>"It's more like one of the very little stars sitting
on the sun's knee," was her comparison, which Baldwin
corrected to the moon&mdash;the sun was too yellow,
he said, to be like a no-colour bubble.</p>

<p>Then they all set to work to try to make double-bubbles,
and Thor actually managed to make three,
one on the top of the other. And Terry made a very
big one run ever so far along the carpet without
breaking, bobbing and dancing along as he blew it
ever so gently.</p>

<p>And as a finish-up they all four put their pipes
into the basin and blew together, making what they
called "bubble-pudding," till the pudding seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
get angry and gurgled and wobbled itself up so high
that it ended by toppling over, and coming to an untimely
end as a little spot of soapy water on the table.</p>

<p>"Pride must have a fall, you see," said Thor.</p>

<p>"It's like the story of the frog that tried to be as
big as an ox," said Terence, at which they all laughed
as a very good joke.</p>

<p>Altogether Peggy's pipes turned out a great success,
and the rainy afternoon passed very happily.</p>

<p>The Sunday that came after that Saturday was
showery, sunny, and rainy by turns, like a child who
having had a great fit of crying and sobbing can't
get over it all at once, and keeps breaking into little
bursts of tears again, long after the sorrow is all over.
But by Monday morning the world&mdash;Peggy's world,
that is to say&mdash;seemed to have quite recovered its
spirits. The sun came out smiling with pleasure,
and even the town birds, who know so little about
trees, and grass, and flowers, and all those delightful
things, hopped about and chirruped as nicely as
could be. The boys set off to school in good spirits,
and while Fanny was taking down the breakfast-things
Peggy got out the little red shoes, and set
them on the window-sill, where they had not been
for several days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, dear little red shoes," she said, softly,
"you may look out again at the pretty sun and the
sky, and the fairy cottage up on the mounting. You
can see it quite plain to-day, dear little shoes. The
clouds is all gone away, and it's shinin' out all white
and beautiful, and I daresay the mamma's standin'
at the door with the baby&mdash;or p'raps," Peggy was
never very partial to the baby, "it's asleep in its
cradle. Yes, I think that's it. And the hens and
cocks and chickens is all pecking about, and the
cows moo'in. Oh, <i>how</i> I do wish we could go and
see them all, don't you, dear little shoes?"</p>

<p>She stood gazing up at the tiny white speck, to
other eyes almost invisible, as if by much gazing it
would grow nearer and clearer to her; there was a
smile on her little face, sweet visions floated before
Peggy's mind of a day, "some day," when mamma
should take her out "to the country," to see for herself
the lovely and delightful sights that same dear
mamma had described.</p>

<p>Suddenly Fanny's voice brought her back to
present things. Fanny was looking rather troubled.</p>

<p>"Miss Peggy, love," she said, "cook and I can't
think what's making Miss Earnshaw so late this
morning. She's always so sharp to her time. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
don't like leaving you alone, but I don't know what
else to do. Monday's the orkardest day, for we're
always so busy downstairs, and your papa was just
saying this morning that I was to tell Miss Earnshaw
to take you a nice long walk towards the
country, seeing as it's so fine a day. It will be right
down tiresome, it will, if she don't come."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Fanny," said Peggy. "I don't
mind much being alone, and I daresay Miss Earnshaw
will come. I <i>should</i> like to go a nice walk
to-day," she could not help adding, with a longing
glance out at the sunny sky.</p>

<p>"To be sure you would," said Fanny, "and it stands
to reason as you won't be well if you don't get no
fresh air. I hope to goodness the girl will come, but
I doubt it&mdash;her mother's ill maybe, and she's no one
to send. Well, dear, you'll try and amuse yourself,
and I'll get on downstairs as fast as I can."</p>

<p>Peggy went back to the window and stood there
for a minute or two, feeling rather sad. It did seem
hard that things should go so very "contrarily"
sometimes.</p>

<p>"Just when it's such a fine day," she thought,
"Miss Earnshaw doesn't come. And on Saturday
when we <i>couldn't</i> have goned a walk she did come.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Only on Saturday it did rain very badly in the
afternoon and she didn't stay, so that wasn't a
pity."</p>

<p>Then her thoughts went wandering off to what
the dressmaker had told her of having to go a long
way out into the country on Saturday afternoon,
and of how wet and muddy the lanes would be.
Peggy sighed; she <i>couldn't</i> believe country lanes
could ever be anything but delightful.</p>

<p>"Oh how <i>very</i> pretty they must be to-day," she
said to herself, "with all the little flowers coming
peeping out, and the birds singing, and the cocks and
hens, and the cows, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;" she was becoming
a little confused. Indeed she wasn't <i>quite</i> sure what
a "lane" really meant&mdash;she knew it was some kind
of a way to walk along, but she had heard the word
"path" too,&mdash;were "lane" and "path" quite the
same? she wondered. And while she was wondering
and gazing out of the window, she was startled all of
a sudden by a soft, faint tap at the door. So soft
and faint that if it had been at the window instead
of at the door it might have been taken for the flap
of a sparrow's wing as it flew past. Peggy stood
quite still and listened; she heard nothing more, and
was beginning to think it must have been her fancy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
when again it came, and this time rather more
loudly. "Tap, tap." Yes, "certingly," thought
Peggy, "there's somebody there."</p>

<p>She felt a little, a <i>very</i> little frightened.</p>

<p>Should she go to the door and peep out, or should
she call "Come in"? she asked herself. And one or
two of the "ogre" stories that Thorold and Terry
were so fond of in their "Grimm's Tales," <i>would</i>
keep coming into her head&mdash;stories of little princesses
shut up alone, or of giants prowling about to find a
nice tender child for supper. Peggy shivered. But
after all what was the use of standing there fancying
things? It was broad, sunny daylight&mdash;not at all
the time for ogres or such-like to be abroad. Peggy
began to laugh at her own silliness.</p>

<p>"Very likely," she thought, "it's Miss Earnshaw
playing me a trick to 'apprise me, 'cos she's so late
this morning."</p>

<p>This idea quite took away her fear.</p>

<p>"It's you, Miss Earnshaw, I'm quite sure it's
you," she called out; "come in quick, you funny
Miss Earnshaw. Come in."</p>

<p>But though the door slowly opened, no Miss
Earnshaw appeared. Peggy began to think this was
carrying fun too far.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you come in quick?" she said, her
voice beginning to tremble a little.</p>

<p>The door opened a little farther.</p>

<p>"Missy," said a low voice, a childish hesitating
voice, quite different from Miss Earnshaw's quick
bright way of speaking, "Missy, please, it's me,
Sarah, please, miss."</p>

<p>And the door opened more widely, and in came,
slowly and timidly still, a small figure well known
to Peggy. It was none other than Light Smiley.</p>

<p>Peggy could hardly speak. She was so very
much astonished.</p>

<p>"Light Smiley&mdash;Sarah, I mean," she exclaimed,
"how did you come? Did you see Fanny? Did
she tell you to come upstairs?"</p>

<p>Sarah shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't know who Fanny is, missy. I just
comed in of myself. The doors was both open, and
I didn't meet nobody. I didn't like for to ring or
knock. I thought mebbe your folk'd scold if I did&mdash;a
gel like me. Mother knows I've comed; she
said as how I'd better bring it myself."</p>

<p>And she held up what Peggy had not noticed
that she was carrying&mdash;the big umbrella that had
caused so much trouble two days before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"The numbrella," cried Peggy. "Oh thank you,
Sarah, for bringing it back. I never thought of it!
How stupid it was of me."</p>

<p>"Mother told me for to bring it to the door and
give it in," Sarah went on. "I didn't mean to come
upstairs, but, the door was open, you see, miss, and
I knowed your nussery was at the top, and&mdash;I 'ope
it's not a liberty."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Peggy, her hospitable feelings
awaking to see that her little visitor was still standing
timidly in the doorway, "I'm <i>very</i> glad you've
comed. You don't know how glad I am. It's so
lonely all by myself&mdash;Miss Earnshaw hasn't come
this morning. Come in, Light Smiley, do come in.
Oh how nice! I can show you the mountings and
the little white cottage shining in the sun."</p>

<p>She drew Sarah forwards. But before the child
looked out of the window, her eyes were caught by
the tiny red slippers on the sill.</p>

<p>"Lor'," she said breathlessly, "what splendid
shoes! Are they for&mdash;for your dolly, missy?
They're too small for a baby, bain't they?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Peggy, "they're too small for our
baby, a great deal. But then he's very fat."</p>

<p>"They'd be too small for ours too, though she's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
not a hextra fine child for her age. She were a
very poor specimint for a good bit, mother says,
but she's pickin' up now she's got some teeth through.
My&mdash;but them shoes is neat, to be sure! They
must be for a dolly."</p>

<p>"<i>I've</i> no doll they'd do for," said Peggy, "but I
like them just for theirselves. <i>I</i> always put them
to stand there on a fine day; they like to look out
of the window."</p>

<p>Sarah stared at Peggy as if she thought she was
rather out of her mind!&mdash;indeed the children at the
back had hinted to each other that missy, for all she
was a real little lady, was very funny-like sometimes.
But Peggy was quite unconscious of it.</p>

<p>"Lor'," said Sarah at last, "how can shoes see,
they've no eyes, missy?"</p>

<p>"But you can <i>fancy</i> they have. Don't you ever
play in your mind at fancying?" asked Peggy. "I
think it's the nicest part of being alive, and mamma
says it's no harm if we keep remembering it's not
real. But never mind about that&mdash;do look at the
hills, Sarah, and oh, <i>can</i> you see the white speck
shining in the sun? <i>That's</i> the cottage&mdash;I call it
my cottage, but <i>p'raps</i>," rather unwillingly, "it's the
one your papa lived in when he was little."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"D'ye really think so?" said Sarah, eagerly.
"It's Brackenshire over there to be sure, and father's
'ome was up an 'ill&mdash;deary me, to think as it might
be the very place. See it&mdash;to be sure I do, as plain
as plain. It do seem a good bit off, but father he
says it's no more'n a tidy walk. He's almost promised
he'll take some on us there some fine day
when he's an 'oliday. I axed 'im all I could think
of&mdash;missy&mdash;all about the cocks and 'ens and cows
and pigses."</p>

<p>"Not pigs," interrupted Peggy. "I don't like
pigs, and I won't have them in my cottage."</p>

<p>"I wasn't a-talking of your cottage," said Sarah,
humbly. "'Twas what father told us of all the
things he seed in the country when he were a boy
there. There's lots of pigses in Brackenshire."</p>

<p>"Never mind. We won't have any," persisted
Peggy. "But oh, Light Smiley, do look how splendid
the sky is&mdash;all blue and all so shiny. I never sawed
such a lovely day. I would so like to go a walk."</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't you?" asked Sarah.</p>

<p>"There's no one to take me," sighed Peggy. "It's
Monday, and Fanny's very busy on Mondays, and I
told you that tiresome Miss Earnshaw's not comed."</p>

<p>Sarah considered a little.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell you what, missy," she said, "why shouldn't
we&mdash;you and me&mdash;go a walk? I'm sure mother'd
let me. I've got my 'at, all 'andy, and I did say to
mother if so as missy seed me I might stop a bit,
and she were quite agreeable. I'm a deal older nor
you, and I can take care of you nicely. Mother's
training me for the nussery."</p>

<p>Peggy started up in delight. She had been half
sitting on the window-sill, beside the shoes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Light Smiley," she said, "how lovely! Of
course you could take care of me. We'd go up
Fernley Road, straight up&mdash;that's the way to
Brackenshire, you know, and p'raps we might go far
enough to see the white cottage plainer. If it's not
a very long way to get there, we'd be sure to see it
much plainer if we walked a mile or two. A mile
isn't very far. Oh, do let's go&mdash;quick! quick!"</p>

<p>But Sarah stopped her.</p>

<p>"You'd best tell your folks first, missy," she said.
"They'll let you go and be glad of it, I should say,
if they're so busy, and seein' as they let you come
over to our 'ouse, and your mar knowin' us and all."</p>

<p>"It was Miss Earnshaw that let me go," said
Peggy, "and then she said she didn't know I'd
goned. And Thor said&mdash;oh no, he only said I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
shouldn't have goned to the shop. But I'll ask
Fanny&mdash;I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll put on my
boots and my hat and jacket&mdash;you shall help me,
Sarah, and then we'll go down and I'll call to Fanny
from the top of the kitchen stairs and ask her if I
may go out with you, Sarah, dear. I'm sure she'll
say I may."</p>

<p>So the two little maidens went into the night
nursery, where Light Smiley was greatly interested
in looking at her own dwelling-place from other
people's windows, and quite in her element too,
seeing that she was being trained for the nursery, in
getting out Peggy's walking things, buttoning her
boots, and all the rest of it.</p>

<br /></div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Light Smiley</span> kept looking round the room with
great satisfaction.</div>

<p>"It is nice in 'ere and no mistake," she said at
last. "Your 'ats and coats and frocks all in a row,
as neat as neat, and these little white beds a sight
to be seen. I should love for Rebecca and Matilda-Jane
to see it."</p>

<p>"They will," said Peggy, "when I avite you all
to a tea-party, you know."</p>

<p>Sarah drew a deep breath. A tea-party in these
beautiful nurseries seemed almost too good ever to
come true.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there a many nusseries as nice as this 'un, do
you think, missy? I do 'ope as I'll get into a nice
one when I'm big enough. One 'ud take a pride in
keeping it clean and tidy."</p>

<p>"I don't think this is at all a <i>grand</i> one,"
Peggy replied. "Mamma's was much grander when
she was little, I know. But, of course, she's very
pertickler, and so's nurse, about it being very tidy."</p>

<p>And then, Peggy being ready, the quaint pair of
friends took each other's hands and set off to the
top of the kitchen stairs.</p>

<p>"Should we take the humberellar?" said Sarah,
suddenly stopping at the foot of the first little flight
of stairs. "I don't think it looks any ways like
rain, still one never knows, and I can carry it easy."</p>

<p>In her heart she hoped Peggy would say yes.
For to Sarah's eyes the clumsy umbrella was a very
"genteel" one indeed, and she felt as if it would add
distinction to their appearance.</p>

<p>Peggy, not looking at it from this point of view,
hesitated.</p>

<p>"P'raps it would do to keep the sun off us," she
said. "My parasol's wored out, so I can't take it.
Mamma's going to get me a new one."</p>

<p>Sarah ran back and fetched the umbrella.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>When they got to the door at the top of the
kitchen stairs, Peggy opened it and called down
softly, "Fanny, are you there? Can you hear me?"
for she was not allowed to go down to the kitchen
by herself.</p>

<p>But no one answered. Fanny was busy washing
in the back kitchen with both doors shut to keep
in the steam, and the cook had gone out to the
butcher's.</p>

<p>"Fanny," called Peggy again.</p>

<p>Then a voice came at last in return.</p>

<p>"Is it anything I can tell the cook when she
comes in, please, miss?" and a boy came forward
out of the kitchen and stood at the foot of the steep
stone stairs. "I'm the baker's boy, and I met cook
and she told me to wait; she'd be back with change
to pay the book in a minute. There's no one here."</p>

<p>Peggy turned to Sarah in distress.</p>

<p>"Fanny must be out too," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, it'll be all right if the boy 'ull tell her,
won't it, missy? 'Tisn't the cook," she went on, speaking
to the boy herself, "'tis t'other one. Jest you
tell her when she comes in that miss has gone out a
little walk with me&mdash;Sarah Simpkins&mdash;she'll know.
I'll take good care of missy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," said the boy, with no doubt that so
it was, and thinking, if he thought at all, that Sarah
Simpkins must be a little nurse-girl, or something of
the kind about the house, though certainly a small
specimen to be in service! He whistled as he turned
away, and something in the cheerful sound of his
whistle helped to satisfy Peggy that all <i>was</i> right!</p>

<p>"He's a nice boy," she said to Sarah. "He won't
forget, will he?"</p>

<p>"Not he," Sarah replied. "He'll tell 'em fast
enough. And as like as not we'll meet 'em along
the street as we go. Is Webb's your butcher, missy&mdash;'tis
just at the corner of Fernley Road?"</p>

<p>Peggy shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, feeling rather ashamed
of her ignorance; "but I'd like to meet Fanny, so,
pelease, let us go that way."</p>

<p>And off the two set, by the front door this time,
quite easy in their minds though, as far as they
knew, the baker's boy was the only guardian of the
house.</p>

<p>They trotted down the street in the sunshine;
it was very bright and fine&mdash;the air, even there in
the smoky town, felt this morning deliciously fresh
and spring-like.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"How nice it is," said Peggy, drawing a deep
breath; "it's just like summer. I'd like to go a
quite long walk, wouldn't you, Sarah?"</p>

<p>Light Smiley looked about her approvingly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I does enjoy a real fine day.
And in the country it must be right-down fust-rate."</p>

<p>"Oh, the country!" said Peggy; "oh dear, how
I do wish we could go as far as the country!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Sarah, "if we walk fast we might
come within sight of it. There's nice trees and
gardings up Fernley Road, and that's a sort of
country, isn't it, missy?"</p>

<p>They were at the corner of the road by this time,
but there was no sign of Fanny or cook. "Webb's"
shop stood a little way down the other side, but as
far as they could see it was empty.</p>

<p>"P'raps your folk don't deal there," said Sarah, to
which Peggy had nothing to say, and they stood
looking about them in an uncertain kind of way.</p>

<p>"We may as well go on a bit," said Sarah at last,
"that there boy's sure to tell."</p>

<p>Peggy had no objection, and they set off along
Fernley Road at a pretty brisk pace.</p>

<p>They had not very far to go before, as Sarah said,
the road grew less town-like; the houses had little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
gardens round them, some of which were prettily
kept, and after a while they came to a field or two,
not yet built upon, though great placards stuck up
on posts told that they were waiting to be sold for
that purpose. They were very towny sort of fields
certainly, still the bright spring sunshine made the
best of them as of everything else this morning, and
the two children looked at them with pleasure.</p>

<p>"There's nicer fields still, a bit farther on," said
Sarah. "I've been along this 'ere road several times.
It goes on and on right into the country."</p>

<p>"I know," said Peggy, "it goes on into the
country of the mountings. But, Sarah," she said,
stopping short, and looking rather distressed, "I
don't think we see them any plainer than from the
nursery window, and the white cottage doesn't look
even as plain. Are you sure we're going the right
way?"</p>

<p>"We couldn't go wrong," answered Sarah, "there's
no other way. But we've come no distance yet,
missy, and you see there's ups and downs in the
road that comes between us and the 'ills somehow.
I suppose at the window we could see straight-forward-like,
and then we was 'igher up."</p>

<p>"Yes, that must be it," said Peggy; "but I would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
like to go far enough to see a <i>little</i> plainer, Sarah,
wouldn't you? I've got the red shoes in my pocket,
you know, and when we come to a place where we
can see very nice and clear I'll take them out and
let them see too."</p>

<p>"Lor'," said Sarah, "you <i>are</i> funny, missy."</p>

<p>But she smiled so good-naturedly that Peggy did
not mind.</p>

<p>After a bit they came to a place where another
road crossed the one they were on. This other road
was planted with trees along one side, and the shade
they cast looked cool and tempting.</p>

<p>"I wish we could go along that way," said Peggy,
"but it would be the wrong way. It doesn't go on
to the mountings."</p>

<p>Sarah did not answer for a minute. She was
trying to spell out some letters that were painted up
on the corner of a wall, which enclosed the garden
of a house standing in the road they were looking
down.</p>

<p>"'B, R, A,'" she began, "'B, R, A, C, K:' it's it,
just look, missy. Bain't that Brackenshire as large
as life? 'Brackenshire Road.' It must be this
way," and she looked quite delighted.</p>

<p>"But how can it be?" objected Peggy. "This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
road <i>doesn't</i> go to the hills, Sarah. They're straight
in front."</p>

<p>"But maybe it slopes round again after a bit,"
said Sarah. "Lots of roads does that way, and runs
the same way really, though you wouldn't think so
at the start. It stands to reason, when it's got the
name painted up, it must lead Brackenshire way;"
and then suddenly, as a man with a basket on his
arm appeared coming out of one of the houses, she
darted up to him.</p>

<p>"Please, mister, does this road lead to Brackenshire?"
she asked.</p>

<p>The man did not look very good-natured.</p>

<p>"Lead to where?" he said, gruffly.</p>

<p>"To Brackenshire&mdash;it's painted up on the wall,
but we want to be sure."</p>

<p>"If it's painted up on the wall, what's the sense
of askin' me?" he said. "If you go far enough no
doubt you'll get there. There's more'n one road to
Brackenshire."</p>

<p>Sarah was quite satisfied.</p>

<p>"You see," she said to Peggy, running back to
her, "it's all right. If we go along this 'ere road a
bit, I 'specs it'll turn again and then we'll see the
'ills straight in front."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Peggy had no objection. Fernley Road was bare
and glaring just about there, and the trees were very
tempting.</p>

<p>"It's really getting like the country," said Peggy,
as they passed several pretty gardens, larger and
much prettier than the small ones in Fernley Road.</p>

<p>"Yes," Light Smiley agreed, "but though gardings
is nice, I don't hold with gardings anything like as
much as fields. Fields <i>is</i> splendid where you can
race about and jump and do just as you like, and no
fears of breakin' flowers or nothink."</p>

<p>"Do you think we shall come to fields like that
soon?" said Peggy. "If there was a very nice one
we might go into it p'raps and rest a little, and look
at the mountings. I wish we could begin to see the
mountings again, Sarah, it seems quite strange
without them, and I'm getting rather tired of looking
at gardens when we can't go inside them, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>Sarah was feeling very contented and happy.
She was, though a little body for her age, much
stronger than Peggy, as well as two years older, and
she looked at her companion with surprise when she
began already to talk of "resting."</p>

<p>"Lor', missy, you bain't tired already," she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
beginning, when she suddenly caught sight of something
which made her interrupt herself. This was
another road crossing the one they were on at right
angles, and running therefore in the same direction
as Fernley Road again. "'Ere's our way," she cried,
"now didn't I tell you so? And this way goes
slopin' up a bit, you see. When we get to the top
we'll see the 'ills straight 'afore us, and 'ave a
beeyutiful view."</p>

<p>Peggy's rather flagging steps grew brisker at this,
and the two ran gaily along the new road for a little
way. But running uphill is tiring, and it seemed to
take them a long time to get to the top of the slope,
and when they did so, it was only to be disappointed.
Neither mountains nor hills nor white
cottage were to be seen, only before them a rather
narrow sort of lane, sloping downwards now and
seeming to lead into some rather rough waste
ground, where it ended. Peggy's face grew rather
doleful, but Sarah was quite equal to the occasion.
A little down the hill she spied a stile, over which
she persuaded Peggy to climb. They found themselves
in a potato field, but a potato field with a
path down the middle; it was a large field and at
the other end of the path was a gate, opening on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a cart track scarcely worthy the name of a lane.
The children followed it, however, till another stile
tempted them again, this time into a little wood,
where they got rather torn and scratched by
brambles and nettles as they could not easily find
a path, and Sarah fancied by forcing their way
through the bushes they would be sure to come out
on to the road again.</p>

<p>It was not, however, till they had wandered backwards
among the trees and brambles for some time
that they got on to a real path, and they had to walk
a good way along this till they at last came on
another gate, this time sure enough opening into the
high road.</p>

<p>Sarah's spirits recovered at once.</p>

<p>"'Ere we are," she said cheerfully, "all right.
'Ere's Fernley Road again. Nothink to do but to
turn round and go 'ome if you're tired, missy. <i>I'm</i>
not tired, but if you'd rayther go no farther&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peggy did not answer for a moment; she was
staring about her on all sides. The prospect was not
a very inviting one; the road was bare and ugly,
dreadfully dusty, and there was no shade anywhere,
and at a little distance some great tall chimneys
were to be seen, the chimneys of some iron-works,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
from which smoke poured forth. There were a good
many little houses near the tall chimneys, they were
the houses of the people who worked there, but they
were not sweet little cottages such as Peggy dreamed
of. Indeed they looked more like a very small ugly
town, than like rows of cottages on a country road.</p>

<p>"This isn't a pretty road at all," said Peggy at
last, rather crossly I am afraid, "it is very nugly,
and you shouldn't have brought me here, Sarah. I
can't see the mountings; they is quite goned away,
more goned away than when it rains, for then they're
only behind the clouds. This isn't Fernley Road,
Light Smiley. I do believe you've losted us, and
Peggy's so tired, and very, very un'appy."</p>

<p>It was Peggy's way when she grew low-spirited to
speak more babyishly than usual; at such times it
was too much trouble to think about being a big girl.
Poor Sarah looked dreadfully distressed.</p>

<p>"Oh, missy dear, don't cry," she said. "If it
bain't Fernley Road, it's <i>a</i> road any way, and there's
no call to be frightened. We can ax our way, but
I'd rayther not ax it at the cottages, for they might
think I was a tramp that'd stoled you away."</p>

<p>"And what would they do then?" asked Peggy,
leaving off crying for a minute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"They'd 'av me up mebbe, and put us in the
lock-ups."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"The place where the pl'ice leaves folk as they
isn't sure about."</p>

<p>"Prison, do you mean?" said Peggy, growing
very pale.</p>

<p>"Well, not ezackly, but somethin' like."</p>

<p>Peggy caught hold of Sarah in sudden terror.</p>

<p>"Oh come along, Light Smiley, quick, quick. Let's
get back into the fields and hide or anything. Oh
come quick, for fear they should catch us." And
she tugged at Sarah, trying to drag her along the
road.</p>

<p>"Stop, missy, don't take on so; there's no need.
We'll just go along quietly and no one'll notice us,
only you stop crying, and then no one'll think any
'arm. We'll not go back the way we came, it's so
drefful thorny, but we'll look out for another road or
a path. I 'spects you're right enough&mdash;this 'ere
bain't Fernley Road."</p>

<p>Peggy swallowed down her sobs.</p>

<p>"I don't think you look quite big enough to have
stolened me, Sarah," she said at last. "But I would
like to get back into the fields quick. If only we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
could see the mountings again, I wouldn't be quite
so frightened."</p>

<p>They had not gone far before they came upon a
gateway and a path leading through a field where
there seemed no difficulties. Crossing it they found
themselves at the edge of the thorny wood, which
they skirted for some way. Peggy's energy, born of
fear, began to fail.</p>

<p>"Sarah," she said at last, bursting into fresh tears,
"Peggy can't go no farther, and I'm so hungry too.
I'm sure it's long past dinner-time. You must sit
down and rest; p'raps if I rested a little, I wouldn't
feel so very un'appy."</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 457px;">
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="457" height="700" alt="&quot;And at last, though she was really so anxious and distressed...." title="" />
</div>
<p>Sarah looked at her almost in despair. She herself
was worried and vexed, very afraid too of the
scolding which certainly awaited her at home, but
she was not tired nor dispirited, though very sorry
for Peggy, and quite aware that it was she and not
"missy" who was to blame for this unlucky expedition.</p>

<p>"I'd like to get on," she said, "we're sure to gets
back into a road as'll take us 'ome before long.
Couldn't I carry you, missy?"</p>

<p>"No," said Peggy, "you're far too little. And
I can't walk any more without resting. You're very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
unkind, Light Smiley, and I wish I'd never seen
you."</p>

<p>Poor Sarah bore this bitter reproach in silence.</p>

<p>She looked about for a comfortable seat in the
hedge, and settled herself so that Peggy could rest
against her. The sunshine, though it had seemed
hot and glaring on the bare dusty road was not
really very powerful, for it was only late April,
though a very summerlike day. Peggy left off
crying and said no more, but leant contentedly
enough against Sarah.</p>

<p>"I'm comf'able now," she said, closing her eyes.
"Thank you, Light Smiley. I'll soon be rested, and
then we'll go on."</p>

<p>But in a moment or two, by the way she breathed,
Sarah saw that she had fallen asleep.</p>



<p>"Bless us," thought the little guardian to herself,
"she may sleep for hours. Whatever 'ull I do?
She's that tired&mdash;and when she wakes she'll be that
'ungry, there'll be no getting her along. She'll be
quite faint-like. If I dared leave her, I'd run on till
I found the road and got somebody to 'elp carry
her. But I dursn't. If she woked up and me gone,
she'd be runnin' who knows where, and mebbe never
be found again. Poor missy&mdash;it'll be lock-ups and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
no mistake, wusser I dessay for me, and quite right
too. Mother'll never say I'm fit for a nussery after
makin' sich a fool of myself."</p>

<p>And in spite of her courage, the tears began to
trickle down Sarah's face. Peggy looked so white
and tiny, lying there almost in her arms, that it
made her heart ache to see her. So she shut her
own eyes and tried to think what to do. And the
thinking grew gradually confused and mixed up
with all sorts of other thinkings. Sarah fancied she
heard her mother calling her, and she tried to
answer, but somehow the words would not come.</p>

<p>And at last, though she was really so anxious
and distressed, the quiet and the mild air, and the
idleness perhaps, to which none of the Simpkins
family were much accustomed, all joined together
and by degrees hushed poor Light Smiley to sleep,
her arms clasped round Peggy as if to protect her
from any possible danger.</p>

<p>It would have been a touching picture, had there
been any one there to see. Unluckily, not merely
for the sake of the picture, but for that of the
children themselves, there was no one.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">When</span> they woke, both of them at the same moment
it seemed, though probably one had roused the other
without knowing it, the sun had gone, the sky
looked dull, it felt chilly and strange. Peggy had
thought it must be past dinner-time before they had
sat down to rest; it seemed now as if it must be
past tea-time too!</div>

<p>Sarah started up, Peggy feebly clinging to her.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, dear," said Sarah, "I shouldn't have
gone to sleep, and it's got that cold!" She was
shivering herself, but Peggy seemed much the worse
of the two. She was white and pinched looking, and
as if she were half stupefied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm so cold," she said, "and so hungry. I
thought I was in bed at home. I do so want to go
home. I'm sure it's very late, Light Smiley; do
take me home."</p>

<p>"I'm sure, missy, it's what I want to do," said
poor Sarah. "I'm afeared it's a-going to rain, and
whatever 'ull we do then? You wouldn't wait 'ere
a minute, would you, while I run to see if there's a
road near?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Peggy, "I won't stay alone. I'm
very, very frightened, Light Smiley, and I think I'm
going to die."</p>

<p>"Oh Lor', missy, don't you say that," said
Sarah, in terror. "If you can't walk I'll carry
you."</p>

<p>"I'll try to walk," said Peggy, picking up some
spirit when she saw Sarah's white face.</p>

<p>And then the two set off again, dazed and miserable,
very different from the bright little pair that
had started up Fernley Road that morning.</p>

<p>Things, however, having got to the worst, began
to mend, or at least were beginning to mend for
them, though Peggy and Sarah did not just yet
know it. Not far from the edge of the field where
they were, a little bridle-path led into a lane, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
few yards down this lane brought them out upon
Fernley Road again at last.</p>

<p>"I see the mountings," cried Peggy, "oh, Light
Smiley, Peggy sees the mountings. P'raps we won't
die, oh p'raps we'll get home safe again."</p>

<p>But though she had been trying to be brave, now
that she began to hope again, it was too much for
her poor little nerves&mdash;Peggy burst into loud sobbing.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear missy, try not to cry," said Sarah.
"There&mdash;there&mdash;where's your hankercher?" and she
dived into Peggy's pocket in search of it. And as
she pulled it out, out tumbled at the same time the
two little scarlet shoes, falling on the ground.</p>

<p>"Oh Light Smiley, my red shoes. They'll be all
spoilt and dirtied," said Peggy, as well as she could,
for Sarah was dabbing the handkerchief all over her
face.</p>

<p>Sarah stooped to pick them up; both children
were too much engaged to notice the sound of wheels
coming quickly along the quiet road. But the sight
of a speck of dirt on one of the shoes set Peggy off
crying again, and she cried for once pretty loudly.
The wheels came nearer, and then stopped, and this
made Sarah look round. A pony-carriage driven by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
a lady had drawn up just beside them. The groom,
sitting behind, jumped down, though looking as if
he did not know what he was to do.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, little girls?" said the lady.</p>

<p>"It's, please'm&mdash;we've lost our road&mdash;it's all
along o' me, mum&mdash;but I didn't mean no 'arm, only
missy's that wore out'm, and&mdash;&mdash;" but before Sarah
could get farther, she was stopped by a sort of cry
from both the lady and Peggy at once.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh," called out Peggy, "it's the shoes-lady&mdash;oh,
pelease, pelease, take me home," and she
seemed ready to dart into the lady's arms.</p>

<p>"I do believe," <i>she</i> said, "I do believe it's the
little girl I saw at the bootmaker's, and&mdash;yes, of
course it is&mdash;there are the shoes themselves! My
dear child, whatever are you doing to be so far from
home&mdash;at least I suppose you live in the town?&mdash;and
what have you got the dolly's shoes with you
for?"</p>

<p>"I brought them for them to see the mountings
and the white cottage," sobbed Peggy; "but I'm so
cold and hungry, pelease take me home, oh, pelease,
do."</p>

<p>The lady seemed rather troubled. Even if she
had not remembered Peggy, she would have seen in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
a moment that she was a little lady, though Peggy
looked miserable enough with her torn clothes, and
scratched and tear-stained face.</p>

<p>"Poor child," she said, "tell me your name, and
where you live."</p>

<p>"I'm Peggy, but I don't 'amember my nother
name, 'cos I'm tired and it's very long," she said.</p>

<p>The lady looked at Sarah. Sarah shook her
head.</p>

<p>"No, mum, I don't know it neither, but I knows
the name of the street. 'Tis Bernard Street'm&mdash;off
Fernley Road, and their back winders looks over to
us. We're Simpkinses'm, and missy's mar knows
as we're 'speckable, and mother she never thought
when she told me to take back the humberellar, as
I'd lead missy sich a dance. I'll never do for the
nussery, no never. I'm not steady enough," and
here Light Smiley gave signs of crying herself.</p>

<p>It was not easy for the lady to make out the
story, but by degrees, with patience she did so. But
while talking she had lifted Peggy into the carriage
beside her, and wrapped her up in a shawl that lay
on the seat, Peggy nestling in, quite contentedly.</p>

<p>"Now," said the lady, "you get in too, Sarah
Simpkins, and I'll drive you both home. I was on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
my way home out into the country, but I can't leave
you here on the road. This is Fernley Road, but
it's quite four miles from the town."</p>

<p>In scrambled Sarah, divided between fear of her
own and Peggy's relations' scoldings when they got
home, and the delight and honour of driving in a
carriage! The groom would have liked to look
grumpy, I am quite sure, but he dared not. Peggy,
for her part, crept closer and closer to the lady, and
ended by falling asleep again, so that it was a good
thing Light Smiley was sitting on the other side, to
keep her from falling out.</p>

<p>The four miles seemed very short to Sarah, and
as they got into the outskirts of the town her face
grew longer and longer.</p>

<p>"I'm more'n half a mind to run away, I 'ave,"
she said to herself, quite unaware she was speaking
aloud. "It'll be more'n I can stand, mother and
Rebecca and all on 'em down on me, for I didn't
mean no 'arm. I'd best run away."</p>

<p>The lady turned to her, hitherto she had not
taken much notice of Sarah, but now she felt sorry
for the little girl.</p>

<p>"What are you saying, my dear?" she said
gently, though all the same her voice made Sarah<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
jump. "Are you afraid of going home? You have
not done anything naughty, exactly, as far as I
understand. It was only thoughtless. I will go
with you to your home if you like, and explain to
your mother how it was."</p>

<p>"Oh thank you, mum," said Sarah, eagerly, her
spirits rising again at once; "you see, mum, I do so
want to be in the nussery onst I'm big enough, and
I was so afeared mother'd never think of it again.
I only wanted to please little missy, for she seemed
so lonely like, her mar and all bein' away and no
one for to take her a walk. She's a sweet little
missy, she is, but she's only a baby, so to say; she
do have such funny fancies. 'Twas all to see the
cottage on the 'ills she wanted to come up Fernley
Road so badly."</p>

<p>"The cottage&mdash;what cottage?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>Sarah tried to explain, and gradually the lady
got to understand what little Peggy had meant
about bringing the red shoes "to see the mountings
and the cottage."</p>

<p>"She's always a-talking of the country, and father
lived there when he was a boy, and missy had got it
in her 'ead that he lived in a white cottage, like the
one she fancies about," Sarah went on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would like to take her out into the real
country, poor little pet," said the lady, looking
tenderly at the sweet tiny face of the sleeping child.
She loved all children, but little girls of Peggy's
age were especially dear to her, for many years
before she had had a younger sister who had died,
and the thought of her had come into her mind the
first time she had seen Peggy at the door of the
shoe shop. "If I can see any of her friends I
will ask them to let her spend a day with me,"
she went on, speaking more to herself than to
Sarah.</p>

<p>As they turned into Bernard Street a cab dashed
past them coming very fast from the opposite direction.
It drew up in front of the house which Sarah
was just that moment pointing out to the lady as
Peggy's home, and a gentleman, followed by a
young woman, sprang out. The door was opened
almost as soon as they rang, and then the three, the
other servant who had answered the bell, the young
woman and the gentleman, all stood together on the
steps talking so anxiously and eagerly that for a
moment or two they did not notice the pony-carriage,
and though the groom knew the whole
story by this time and had jumped down at once, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
was far too proper to do anything till he had his
lady's orders.</p>

<p>"Ask the gentleman to speak to me," said the
lady, "and you jump out, little Sarah. I think he
must be Peggy's father."</p>

<p>He had turned round by this time and came
hurrying forward. The moment the lady saw him
she knew she had guessed right. He was so like
Peggy&mdash;fair and gray-eyed, and with the same gentle
expression, and very young looking to be the father
not only of Peggy, but of <i>big</i> little boys like Thor
and Terry. His face looked pale and anxious, but
the moment he caught sight of the little sleeping
figure leaning against the lady it all lighted up and
a red flush came into his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;thank God," he exclaimed, "my little
Peggy! You have found her! How good of you!
But&mdash;she is not hurt?&mdash;she is all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;only cold and hungry and tired,"
said the lady eagerly, for Peggy did look rather
miserable still. "Will you lift her out?" and as
he did so, she got out herself, and turned to Sarah.
"May I bring this other child in for a moment,"
she said, "and then I can explain it all?"</p>

<p>Sarah followed gladly, but a sudden thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
struck her, "Please'm," she said, bravely, though the
tears came to her eyes as she spoke, "p'raps I'd best
run 'ome; mother'll be frightened about me."</p>

<p>"But I promised you should not be scolded," said
the lady; "stay," and she turned to Fanny, "she
lives close to, she says."</p>

<p>"At the back&mdash;over the cobbler's," said Sarah,
readily.</p>

<p>"Can you let her mother know she's all right,
then? And say I am coming to speak to her in a
moment," said the lady, and Fanny went off. She
had been so terrified about Peggy, and so afraid that
she would be blamed for carelessness, that she dared
not wait, though she was dying with curiosity to
know the whole story and what one of the Simpkins
children could have had to do with it.</p>

<p>Peggy awoke by the time her father had got her
into the dining-room, where cook had made a good
fire and laid out Peggy's dinner and tea in one to be
all ready, for the poor woman had been hoping
every instant for the last few hours that the little
girl would be brought home again. It had been
difficult to find Peggy's father, as he was not at his
office, and Fanny had been there two or three times
to fetch him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh dear papa," were Peggy's first words, "I'm
so glad to be home. I'll never go up Fernley Road
again; but I did so want to see the cottage and the
mountings plainer. And it wasn't Light Smiley's
fault. She was very good to me, and I was very
cross."</p>

<p>This did not much clear up matters. Indeed
Peggy's papa was afraid for a minute or two that his
little girl was going to have a fever, and that her
mind was wandering. But all such fears were soon
set at rest, and when the lady went off with Sarah,
she left Peggy setting to work very happily at her
dinner or tea, she was not sure which to call it.</p>

<p>"And you will let her come to spend the day
with me to-morrow?" said the lady, as she shook
hands with Peggy's father. "I shall be driving this
way, and I can call for her. I should not be happy
not to know that she was none the worse for her
adventures to-day."</p>

<p>Then the lady took Sarah by the hand and went
round with her to her home in the back street,
telling the groom to wait for her at the corner.</p>

<p>It was well she went herself, for otherwise I am
afraid poor Light Smiley would not have escaped
the scolding she dreaded. Her mother and sisters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
had been very unhappy and frightened about her,
and when people&mdash;especially poor mothers like Mrs.
Simpkins, with "so many children that they don't
know what to do"&mdash;are anxious and frightened, I
have often noticed that it makes them very cross.</p>

<p>As it was, however, the lady managed to smoothe
it all down, and before she left she got not only Sarah's
mother, but Rebecca and Mary-Hann and all of
them to promise to say no more about it.</p>

<p>"'Tisn't only for myself I was feelin' so put
about, you see, ma'am," said Mrs. Simpkins, "but
when I sent over the way and found the little missy
was not to be found it flashed upon me like a
lightenin' streak&mdash;it did that, ma'am&mdash;that the two
was off together. And if any 'arm had come to the
little lady through one of mine, so to say, it would
'ave gone nigh to break my 'art. For their mar is a
sweet lady&mdash;a real feelin' lady is their mar."</p>

<p>"And a kind friend to you, I daresay," said the
stranger.</p>

<p>"Couldn't be a kinder as far as friendly words
and old clotheses goes," said Mrs. Simpkins. "But
she's a large little fam'ly of her own, and not so very
strong in 'ealth, and plenty to do with their money.
And so to speak strangers in the place, though she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
'ave said she'd do her best to get a place in a nice
fam'ly for one of my girls."</p>

<p>The lady glanced at the group of sisters.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I should think you could spare
one or two. How would you like to be in a kitchen?"
she added, turning to Rebecca.</p>

<p>The girl blushed so that her face matched her
arms, and she looked more "reddy" than ever. But
she shook her head.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid&mdash;&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, thank you kindly, but I couldn't
spare Rebecca," the mother interrupted. "If it were
for Mary-Hann now&mdash;Matilda-Jane's coming on and
could take her place. Only, for I couldn't deceive
you, ma'am, she's rather deaf."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mind that," said the lady, who was
pleased by Mary-Ann's bright eyes and pleasant
face. "I think deaf people sometimes work better
than quick-hearing ones, besides, it may perhaps be
cured. I will speak about her to my housekeeper
and let you know. And you, Sarah, you are to be
in the nursery some day."</p>

<p>Sarah grinned with delight.</p>

<p>"Not just yet," said Mrs. Simpkins; "she 'ave a
deal to learn, 'ave Sarah. Schooling and stiddiness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to begin with. She don't mean no 'arm, I'll
allow."</p>

<p>"No; I'm sure she wants to be a very good girl,"
said the lady. "She was very kind and gentle to
little Miss Peggy. So I won't forget you either,
Sarah, when the time comes."</p>

<p>And then the lady said good-bye to them all, and
Mrs. Simpkins's heart felt lighter than for long, for
she was sure that through this new friend she might
get the start in life she had been hoping for, for her
many daughters.</p>

<p>Peggy slept off her fatigue, and by the next
morning she was quite bright again and able to listen
to and understand papa's explanation of how, though
without meaning to be disobedient, she had done
wrong the day before in setting off with Sarah
Simpkins as she had done. Two or three tears
rolled slowly down her cheeks as she heard what
he said.</p>

<p>"I meant to be so good while mamma was away,"
she whispered. "But I'll never do it again, papa.
I'll stay quiet in the nursery all alone, even if Miss
Earnshaw doesn't come back at all."</p>

<p>For a message had come from the dressmaker
that her mother was very ill, as Fanny had feared,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and that she was afraid she would not be able to
leave her for several days.</p>

<p>"It won't be so bad as that, dear," said her father.
"Mamma will be back in five days now, and I don't
think you are likely to be left alone in the nursery&mdash;certainly
not to-day;" and then he told her about
the lady having asked her to spend the day out in
the country with her, and that Peggy must be ready
by twelve o'clock, not to keep her new friend waiting.</p>

<p>Peggy's eyes gleamed with delight.</p>

<p>"Out into the country?" she said. "Oh, how
lovely! And oh, papa, do you think <i>p'raps</i> she lives
in a white cottage?"</p>

<p>Papa shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's not a cottage at all where she
lives," he said. "But I'm sure it is a very pretty
house, and let us hope it is a white one."</p>

<p>"No," said Peggy, "you don't understand, papa&mdash;not
as well as mamma does. I don't care what
colour it is if it's only an 'ouse."</p>

<p>And she couldn't understand why papa laughed
so that he really couldn't correct her. "I'm afraid,
Peggy," he said, "you've been taking lessons from
little Miss Simpkins. It's time mamma came home
again to look after you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I wish mamma was come home again,"
said Peggy. "We can't do without her, can we,
papa?"</p>

<p>But when the dear little pony carriage came up
to the door, and Peggy got in and drove off with her
kind friend, she was so happy that she had not even
time to wish for mamma.</p>

<p>And what a delightful day she had! The lady's
house was very pretty, and the gardens and woods
in which it stood even prettier in Peggy's opinion.
And though it was not a cottage, there were all the
country things to see which Peggy was so fond of&mdash;cocks
and hens, and cows, and in one field lots of
sheep and sweet little lambkins. There were pigs
too, which Peggy would not look at, but ran away to
the other end of the yard as soon as she heard them
"grumphing," which amused the lady very much.
And in the afternoon she went a walk with her
friend through the village, where there were several
pretty cottages, but none that quite fitted Peggy's
fancy. When they came in again Peggy stood at
the drawing-room window, which looked out towards
Brackenshire, without speaking.</p>

<p>"You like that view, don't you, dear?" said the
lady. "You can see the hills?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Peggy, "I can see the mountings, but
not the white cottage. It's got turned wrong somehow,
from here. I can only see <i>it</i> from the nursery
window at home," and she gave a very little sigh.</p>

<p>"Some day," said the lady, "some day in the
summer when the afternoons are very long, I will
drive you right out a long way among the hills, and
perhaps we'll find the cottage then. For I hope
your mamma will often let you come to see me, my
little Peggy."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peggy, "that would be lovely. I
<i>wonder</i> if we'd find the white cottage."</p>

<p>No, they never did! The sweet long summer
days came, and many a bright and happy one Peggy
spent with her kind friend, but they never found the
white cottage on the hill. Peggy knew it so well in
her mind, she felt she could not mistake it, but
though she saw many white cottages which any one
else <i>might</i> have thought was it, she knew better.
And each time, though she sighed a little, she hoped
again.</p>

<p>But before another summer came round Peggy
and her father and mother, and Thor, and Terry, and
Hal, and Baldwin, and Baby had all gone away&mdash;far
away to the south, many hours' journey from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
dingy town and the Fernley Road, and the queer
old house in the back street where lived the cobbler
and old Mother Whelan and Brown Smiley and
Light Smiley and all the rest of them. Far away
too from the hills and the strange white speck in the
distance which Peggy called her cottage.</p>

<p>So it never was more than a dream to her after
all, and perhaps&mdash;perhaps it was best so? For
nothing has ever spoilt the sweetness and the
mystery of the childish fancy&mdash;she can see it with
her mind's eye still&mdash;the soft white speck on the far-away,
blue hills&mdash;she can see it and think of it and
make fancies about it even now&mdash;now that she has
climbed a long, long way up the mountain of life,
and will soon be creeping slowly down the other
side, where the sun still shines, however, and there
are even more beautiful things to hope for than the
sweetest dreams of childhood.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
